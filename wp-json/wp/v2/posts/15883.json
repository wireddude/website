And I use no more than a piece of paper and a pencil or I type it out into a word document. I do it this way because if it is not simple, most people will never take this first step. Sure, a person can advance to excel spreadsheets and other great tools, but it all starts with a simple list of recurring expenses starting with the largest one and going down the line.<\/p>\n<p>The first step to overcoming online spending addiction is to set a realistic budget for your online purchases. This will help you to understand how much you can afford to spend and avoid overspending. You can use online budgeting tools or apps to help you track your expenses and stay on track.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here is a video of how to manage money during challenging times:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_26561\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eh8Sg0MAnSk?enablejsapi=1&#038;list=PLms5WdQ8kVazCfY6TdDilsrQaj2KnX-tr&#038;index=11&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Take a Technology Break<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Our brains are literally being re wired in this never ending screen time we live with today. and not in a good way. I am generally a supporter of technology that improves the human condition, but there is typically a dark side that needs to be managed.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, taking a break from online shopping can help you to break the cycle of addiction. This can involve temporarily deactivating your social media accounts, unsubscribing from email newsletters, or disabling one-click ordering on shopping websites. Taking a break can help you to reassess your spending habits and focus on other activities that bring you joy. <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">online shopping addiction<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Seek Support<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you are struggling with online spending addiction, it is important to seek support from friends, family, or a professional therapist.

Additionally, seeking professional help can provide you with additional tools and resources to help you overcome your online shopping addiction.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Understand Your Relationship with Shopping<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Technology aside, many people have shopping addictions or poor shopping habits.
