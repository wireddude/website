Asteroid Hitting Earth?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Nope! While we usually cover financial topics here are some recent asteroid encounters with Earth over the past year. As far we we know, no known reports of a major asteroid hitting earth has been cited since the dinosaurs were wiped out, (and any of their savings.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list ol1\">\n<li>December 3, 2024: A small asteroid, 27.5 inches wide, entered Earth&#8217;s atmosphere over Siberia, creating a bright fireball and was detected only 12 hours prior.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>December 4, 2024: The stadium-sized asteroid 2020 XR passed 1.37 million miles from Earth. This was considered a safe distance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>December 6, 2024: Asteroid 2024 WH6 made a close approach, passing Earth at a safe distance of 2.4 million kilometers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>November 25, 2024: The asteroid 2024 PT5, roughly the size of a bus, ended its phase as a &#8220;mini-moon&#8221; of Earth\u2014a temporary capture by Earth&#8217;s gravity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 25, 2024: A &#8220;potentially hazardous&#8221; asteroid, 2002 NV16, passed near Earth among six others that approached our planet closely that day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">These events highlight the ongoing monitoring and study of asteroids by space agencies like NASA and ESA, aimed at assessing potential impact risks. Would you change any of your investment strategies knowing that these events are possible and there are future asteroids identified that have not yet arrived near our planet?  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/asteroid-next-to-earth.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17997\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/asteroid-next-to-earth.png 1024w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/asteroid-next-to-earth-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/asteroid-next-to-earth-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"future-encounters\">Future Encounters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Looking ahead, several known asteroids are projected to make close approaches to Earth in the coming years.
