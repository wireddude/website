Overconsumption is a modern issue and our society and environment fuel the fire. But the impact is not only on your wealth building capacity, this also effects health and well being.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>According to Experian, <b>average total consumer debt in 2022 was $101,915<\/b>. That&#8217;s up nearly 10% from 2020, when average total consumer debt was $92,727!!!<\/h3>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>But the odds are stacked against you. We live in an environment that is constantly manipulating us into consuming and spending more. Ever watched <em>Mad Men<\/em>? Literally thousands of companies, people and machines out with one simple mission, part you from your money.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Your More Than A Consumer<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You will commonly be defined by the mass media as a &#8220;Consumer&#8221;. You are not a consumer, you are first and foremost a person with thoughts, conciousness, and can be an integral member of society through good actions.<\/p>\n<p>I challenge you to think beyond the consumer label.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Millionaire Next Door<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The cold hard truth is that most millionaires in the US are made through diligent consistent investing combined with healthy spending and consuming habits. They simply consume less so that they free up capital to invest.<\/p>\n<p>I understand this will go over most people&#8217;s heads because it just seems to easy. Yes, simple concept, hard to implement for most people.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reduce Consumption and Be Stronger<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Simply put, reducing consumption will make a person healthier and wealthier. We live in a very wasteful environment. We rarely think about the true cost of our spending. We are also blind to the energy costs of producing too much and then the long range environmental costs.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What Can We Do?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>Here are ways to reduce consumption and save money:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>Improve Your Relationship with Money<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The heart of money problems are both external environment and internal mindset. In order to reduce consumption and improve our lives, we must develop a healthy relationship with money. People are taught such crazy things about money. Like money is the root of all evil. What a lie. Money is neutral and can be utilized as a tool for good or bad. Money is energy, intention and a store of value.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reduce Media Consumption<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Even too much media consumption is a problem and can lead to even more bad money habits.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Be mindful of your energy use<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Turn off lights when you leave a room, unplug appliances when they&#8217;re not in use, and set your thermostat to a comfortable but energy-efficient temperature. Conserve water.\u00a0Take shorter showers, fix any leaks, and water your lawn and plants efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>This may sound like a small thing. But small shifts like this shift our mindset and can set us on a new trajectory over time. This one is less about the money and more about slightly adjusting your perspective. Do not even waste the little things.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Recycle and compost<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Recycling and composting is another subtle shift that helps our society but for us personally trains our minds. This will help reduce the amount of waste we send to the landfill but mainly helps us be a more integrated and wise participant in the world. These first two are warmups to get our mind aligned into a frugal and wise mindset when it comes to consumption.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Shop less (Buy Nothing Groups)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Before you buy something, ask yourself if you really need it. If you can&#8217;t answer yes, then don&#8217;t buy it. And have you shopped around to discounts?<\/p>\n<p>Shopping less actually has 3 subcategories that can make a huge impact on your quality of life and wealth building. <strong>They are stuff, homes and cars.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>-stuff<\/strong>: Ever seen hoarders? Stuff has a cost beyond the initial price. We must store it, think about it and maintain it. Is it something you truly require to function in life? Are you buying stuff because it feeds a perceived self worth? Many people feel defined by their stuff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>-homes:<\/strong> Are you spending an appropriate amount on a home? We are constantly goaded into buying the most home we can. This is a mistake. Homes cost so much to maintain over the years. And the bigger the home the greater those costs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_34198\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/AajU_I8UUSE?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>cars-\u00a0<\/strong>Vehicles are another area where Americans just spend too much and over consume.
