I got into comics and trading cards as a kid. I enjoyed the art, the imagination, the worlds I could enter and inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>Collectibles inspired me to dream and create. In fact, I started copying the comic book art and this lead to a lifelong passion for drawing, painting and creating new things.<\/p>\n<p>As an adult I still appreciated the art and hobby of collecting. It was a way to connect with other people and enjoy something unique in this world.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>But&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>But something is wrong with the collecting world as we enter 2024. \u00a0I will cover some of the issues with collecting and offer my best advice for those interested in the hobby.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Magic the Gathering<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For many years I have enjoyed playing, collecting and at times investing in Magic cards. But the last few months I have really re assessed my relationship with this game and collectible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Greed<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My biggest issue with the hobby at the moment is greed and a hedonic treadmill that has become nauseating. For too long now Wizards and Hasbro has just pummeled the consumer with product with what has felt like every couple weeks. I understand that I do not need to buy everything they make, but when so much is being printed, nothing feels particularly special or unique. It all just feels like corporate greed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Breakdown in community<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe I sound like a nostalgic ass, but I remember a time when me and some friends would get excited about a set, crack boxes together and build decks and enjoy getting to know a set for a while. With so much product, it creates a breakdown in cohesion and community.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to sit in a room alone with piles and piles of boxes of cardboard cards. That just feels like being a loser. It was about sharing and discussing with friends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Holiday layoffs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Then December of 2023 rolls around and Wizards lays off a huge amount of staff while making huge profits. Enough is enough.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bulk (Heavy Bags)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One huge problem with buying boxes of magic cards is what to do with the bulk. These are the 95% of cards that are worthless pieces of cardboard. Over the last few years there has just been too much of this trash produced and now people sit on large amounts of this bulk taking up precious closet space. Almost all of it will never be worth anything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trimming down<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Time to trim the collection, take a pause in buying and really only pick up a few cards or packs here and there.<\/p>\n<p>SEE RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/10\/batman-89-movie-cards-worth\/\">Batman Movie Cards<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Comics<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I love comics for many personal reasons. I grew up amazed by the art, stories ad imagination of them. Comic heroes gave me something to hold up as an ideal. Superman always had a pure heart and tried to do the right thing even when it hurt. Batman did what he could to fight injustice and protect innocents. Spiderman was an awkward teen with an amazing ability that he learned to harness. There are countless others that are amazing and our modern mythology.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Limitless imagination<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The good news is that comics as an art form is still alive after all these years. \u00a0But, again, we need a refresh.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Movies???<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I remember going to comic con as a kid and it was all about the art and the super heroes. Then around 2000 it became about Hollywood. I enjoy many of the movies, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs a refresh and is getting stale. And again, they have clobbered us over the head in the pursuit of continual profits.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Variant covers?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Here is a current comic gripe, too many variant covers. I love a good cover, but some issues now have 23 different covers and it is hard to understand which one is the most collectible or sought after. And speaking of covers, I do not like when they make a nice cover, but the interior art and story are lacking.<\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_34551\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rbw-ujuEMXs?enablejsapi=1&#038;list=PLms5WdQ8kVaw6q39rGju6pboDogLGwuOF&#038;index=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Time to Be Choosy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This al adds up to a main resolution: be choosy and picky with collectibles. Either play magic for fun. Or pick up comics for cheap entertainment. But if you are investing in any way, be very careful. I have said it for the last couple of years. It is high time to be very picky about collectibles. The first rule is to only collect what you enjoy or like.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9OBErVfdm1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2022\/07\/star-wars-collectibles-2\/\">Levels of Star Wars Collectibles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Levels of Star Wars Collectibles&#8221; &#8212; The Money Vikings - Truewealth\" src=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2022\/07\/star-wars-collectibles-2\/embed\/#?secret=gMRKoFyO3n#?secret=9OBErVfdm1\" data-secret=\"9OBErVfdm1\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_40521\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/iZU5vgdnXE0?enablejsapi=1&#038;list=PLms5WdQ8kVaw6q39rGju6pboDogLGwuOF&#038;index=27&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Money Vikings know that we have covered a lot of collectibles over the years.
