Let me tell you why I am a heavy real estate investment trust investor. Firs of all, there is something there. Many businesses, investments and crypto are not fundamentally supported by anything tangible. If a new better crypto comes around, then the old one goes poof. If a competitor out competes a top business, then the value goes down. If a technological change disrupts a certain industry, then the business can go down.<\/p>\n<p>This is basically what Warren Buffett talks about when he wants to find businesses to invest in with wide moats. Competition is blocked from getting over that wide moat.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Real Estate is Different<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I believe well managed REIT&#8217;s have built in wide moats. The reason is because underpinning their business they have something that can never be recreated: real property.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Realty Income (O), 5% dividend yield<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div>\n<p data-cy-id=\"company-summary-desc\">Yes, Realty Income, the golden child of REITs for damn good reasons.<\/p>\n<p data-cy-id=\"company-summary-desc\">To date, the company has declared <b>637 consecutive common stock monthly dividends<\/b> throughout its 54-year operating history and increased the dividend 121 times since Realty Income&#8217;s public listing in 1994 (NYSE: O).<\/p>\n<p data-cy-id=\"company-summary-desc\">They own and operate properties with tenants such as Home Depot, Kroger, Fedex, 7-11, Walgreens, Walmart, CVS and more.

It has been hit since it holds about 18% of its portfolio in office properties. Those properties either need to be filled again, possible, or re imagined, possible as well.<\/p>\n<p>If you can deal with a little uncertainty over the near term, you might want to give this REIT a try, given that it hasn&#8217;t been this cheap since the last bear market. It has a number of enticing attributes.<\/p>\n<p>For example, W.P. Carey is one of the largest net-lease REITs. It is not an upstart with a short history, it is a well-known and respected company. As one of the largest players in the net-lease niche, it also has the scale to get sizable transactions done. Both of these factors make it an attractive financial partner to potential tenants.<\/p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the wide diversification within the portfolio. Roughly 29% of rents come from industrial assets, 24% from warehouses, 17% from retail, 16% office (as noted above), 4% self storage, and a rather large 10% from &#8220;other.&#8221; The company also generates a sizable 39% of rents from outside the United States, mostly Europe. You would be hard pressed to find a REIT with as much diversification.<\/p>\n<p>This broad exposure to different property markets and geographic regions allows W.P. Carey to be highly opportunistic in its investment approach, something for which highly focused net-lease peers simply don&#8217;t have the portfolio leeway. The self-storage assets being sold to U-Haul, for example, could be replaced with warehouses and it wouldn&#8217;t be a business model stretch in any way.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_67752\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/as184wH4BK0?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"sc-1pvhpqh-4 gbavyA\">\n<div class=\"sc-1968dbs-1 gNaTBP\" data-cy-id=\"risk-reward-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_82344\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jRDDpkvXCCs?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 REITs You Must Own to Get Rich!
