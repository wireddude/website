Although there are still a few buy and hold equities for the long run, but I have realized there is a great benefit to holding a basket of stocks with a particular mix in order to balance the risk that comes from individual securities. Some even say we should very rarely hold individual stock and opt for broad based ETF&#8217;s and funds.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Investment &#8220;Long Boats&#8221; or &#8220;RELAX AND DO SOME MEDITATION INVESTMENTS&#8221;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">On the journey to FI (Financial Independence), one of <\/span><span class=\"s2\">the biggest questions is to identify investment vehicles or what we call investment &#8220;longboats&#8221;. There are obviously many options available that run the gambit from S&amp;P500 Index funds, Bond funds, REITS, Stocks, etc. In many ways there are too many options. One must determine how comfortable they are with risk and their projected time frame prior to jumping into any investment. I am re framing these as investments that I really do not worry about. I can add positions, sit back and enjoy the ride. Is there risk, yes, but I believe these are investments that will allow a person to do some meditation and yoga and not track too closely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span class=\"s2\">For most folks the best way to invest is in broad based exchange traded funds or index funds that are balanced to match individual risk tolerance. Things like the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Fund VDADX, Vanguard U.S. Growth or Vanguard Wellington Fund, etc. There are many highly rated and diversified mutual funds and exchange traded funds that give an investor exposure to the broader market and the opportunity for compound growth.<\/span><\/em><\/h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span class=\"s2\">But after these types of accounts have been funded, some of us also like to identify long term companies and funds to hold and profit from. The individual stock approach takes more research and involves more risk and should be balanced with various funds.<\/span><\/em><\/h3>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>VIKING LONGBOATS<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">Investment &#8220;longboats&#8221; are what carry a person and provide the leverage to build wealth over time and sustain their cost of living. in other words, without investment vehicles money would simply sit in a savings account. This is a good start, but the problem is with inflation. Inflation simply erodes the purchasing power of each dollar in a savings account. Over the course of a 20, 30, 40 or <\/span><span class=\"s2\">50 year<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> retirement period, that money will lose buying power every year. $300,000 sitting in a savings account will only have the buying power of $100,000 or lower over time and so on. This means that our money needs to make money in order to grow wealth and beat inflation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Therefore, our money must earn money. We need to invest to earn some kind of healthy interest rate. This is how we tripled net worth in 8 years using the <a href=\"https:\/\/themoneyvikings.net\/2018\/12\/21\/the-investing-trifecta-how-i-tripled-net-worth-in-10-years\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Investing Trifecta.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A simple approach<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">I do not enjoy managing complicated portfolios. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Therefore<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> it can be a great strategy to find long term investments that can be acquired, added too and left alone to compound for many years to come.<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> Warren Buffett famously has a stock holding period of ideally \u201cforever\u201d.<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> In other words, find well managed companies, with a straightforward product, high moats and barriers to entry for competition, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">Forever is not realistic for most us, but a very long time is probably the best strategy. We want to ignore day to day gyrations in the stock market if we are long term investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The basics: own the market through index funds<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">Vanguard founder Jack Bogle famously popularized the concept owning a slice of the entire market through index funds. This is the strategy for millions, including myself, for the majority of the portfolio. The key here is to dollar cost average and keep expenses low as you <\/span><span class=\"s2\">buys<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> index shares every couple of weeks.See our related strategy, THE INVEStING TRIFECTA.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s2\">But if you have this strategy down, it might be time to diversify into some high quality individual stocks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">See<\/span><span class=\"s2\">, the entire market <\/span><span class=\"s2\">(i.e. S&amp; P 500) <\/span><span class=\"s2\">is actually estimated to return a bummer decade, with experts saying perhaps a 2% return. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">This may not keep up with inflation and is not much better than a high yield savings account. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">I am still going to acquire shares of index funds over this time, but I am also diversifying into some individual stocks that pay dividends and REITS. But what stocks should be considered?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">Investing in individual stocks is by nature difficult and risky. Even the pros like Warren B<\/span><span class=\"s2\">uffett makes mistakes at times, think Kraft-Heinz!<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> In this article we present stocks from companies that appears to have a bright future. I am also partial to income, therefore have tried to focus on stocks that pay a dividend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">Over the long haul a person may want a couple things from their investments. Firstly<\/span><span class=\"s2\">,<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> to allow that investment to go up in value to outpace inflation. This way your money is able to keep its buying power over time. Secondly<\/span><span class=\"s2\">,<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> perhaps to earn some income along the way in a somewhat safe dividend. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">This can help sustain a person\u2019s lifestyle. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">And thirdly, to take advantage of compound interest to allow the investment to feed on itself and grow on itself over time. This is a kind of leverage that makes your wealth building e<\/span><span class=\"s2\">fforts easier on you over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Quality stocks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s3\">Although we mainly invest in ETF&#8217;s and index funds, we also like to take a small percentage of our portfolios and acquire high quality stocks. We look at<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> several factors to compile a<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> list<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> of quality stocks<\/span><span class=\"s3\">. <\/span><span class=\"s3\">For example, is the stock a dividend aristocrat or king? This means that the stock persistently paid dividends over 25 or 50 plus year periods. Companies that have done this have proven that they can weather various economic environments and have a product that people need and adds value. This illustrates<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> longevity and reliability<\/span><span class=\"s3\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s3\">I also like to check if some of the great stock pickers like Buffett believe in the company. Does the company sell a product that people appear to need well into the future? <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Is the company large and well diversified yet at the same time have focus on core values? Does the company have a sound management team? How is revenue growing? Is debt under control and acquired for investing in innovation with a potential <\/span><span class=\"s3\">return on investment? What do analysts say? Will I want to buy more shares even if the share price dips at times? Are demographic trends behind some of the growth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\">I am not an expert with all the answers to all these questions, but it gives an idea and a framework for analyzing an investment from your own perspective. Investments and the economy tend to go up and down in cycles. We seem to get 7-10 growth years followed by a few down years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">All this said, here are what many say are high quality stocks\/FUNDS for the long run:<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">1.

It is famous for its strength of performance, strong portfolio and for the monthly dividend they pay per share. As an equity REIT, this means that they own, operate and lease the commercial real estate they own. And as a REIT, they return 90% of the profits and dividends back to shareholders each and every month.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you ever wonder who owns the actual building you are walking in when you patronize a Walmart, Walgreens, Taco Bell, AMC movie theater, Home Depot, gas station, etc. Did you play Monopoly as a kid and want to own as many luxury properties as possible? Guess what, as an adult we can now own a small slice of many great properties via Real Estate Investment Trusts such as Realty Income (Ticker: O).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A small fraction of your purchase at many stores goes to paying rent on that property. Many times it is not the company you are patronizing that owns the property. In many cases it could be Realty Income based in San Diego, California, who own over 5,100 properties with 249 commercial tenants operating in 47 industries. Talk about diversified. And one thing people always seem to need: real estate in some shape or form.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">.23 a share each and every month spins off to shareholders. The shares trade at about $79\/share.<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Realty Income, stock symbol &#8220;O&#8221;,\u00a0is a way to gain investment exposure to the real estate sector without the headache and hassle of becoming a landlord. Realty Income is known as &#8220;The Monthly Dividend Company&#8221; because they pride themselves on their monthly dividend since 1969 that has increased over time. To me, it kind of has that feeling of collecting rent each month off your property. But again, the great thing about this kind of investment is that there is zero hassle in terms of managing properties and tenants. It is a stock that is purchased and then one can either collect the dividends each month as income or have them reinvested.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">A &#8220;Dividend Machine&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Realty Income is a great example of a dividend machine that just keeps on spinning off income to investors. O generates stable and predictable income. I think of O as a sleep well at night investment vehicle. Sure, it will have its ups and downs like all stocks and companies, but many analysts see this as a great long term dividend stock to own.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4160 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/themoneyvikings.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/saupload_MZX4ZjRW4ym1ILUe7Xv3VMF9-f3vmGo1yveT4QfFwEiSOZXP-OP_wHAklO97dduPaazPmvy8SkvulINDDh20Px_Dm1Xt7j7lVQd8z-noEVHm6Gm_8C_rjP-Z55lpfxlJHayT3F63-1024x651.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"407\"><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"s8\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span class=\"s7\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">6. <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s7\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">Johnson &amp; Johnson<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s7\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">\u00a0(JNJ)<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4044 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/themoneyvikings.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/00ACE973-04B0-4DEA-8F10-B62B7E4BFD68-300x217.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PERFORMANCE: 5 year : 51%<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DIVIDEND YIELD: 2.65%<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s5\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Johnson &amp; Johnson is a legendary dividend growth stock, with 56 consecutive years of dividend increases.

Or we have taken the medicines or used the medical devices manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson. In other words, if you have a human body, at some point you will need something from JNJ. We all have physical bodies that require all kinds of care and attention from cradle to grave. Therefore all along the way Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is providing the moisturizers, lotions, wipes, machines, medicines, etc. that are needed to be clean, pain free, cure and become healthier.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Diverse revenue streams<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">JNJ sells products well beyond band aids and the like which only account for 18% of their business. The medical devise division accounts for 35% and pharmaceuticals account for the bulk of sales at 47%! Having various revenue streams protects the business from competition and each one has what Warren Buffett calls a &#8220;wide moat&#8221;.\u00a0<span class=\"s5\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">On a year-over-year basis, total revenue increased 12.6% (core organic revenue up 4.3%), while adjusted earnings-per-share <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"s17\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span class=\"s16\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">7.

This gives an investor exposure to some of the greatest and strongest US companies: MSFT, JNJ, PG, HD, ABBT, DIS, WLMT, etc. Therefore, it is one of my largest held assets because it provides a very foundation of growth and exposure to great companies. meanwhile, it pays a constant 1.7% dividend yeild each quarter.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>CONCLUSION<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Investing by nature carries risk.
