Sure, there are little squabbles here and there, but all normal stuff. For the most part, the American hemisphere can sustain itself. Unfortunately western Europe has proven to be way to dependent on cheap oil from corrupt nations. Here&#8217;s hoping for no World War 3<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Bad News<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The bad news is less stability in the world, increases expenditures on military activities, less free trade, less cheap goods, loss of life and assets in other parts of the world.

BUT, the real estate needs to be acquired in strategic locations that are more resilient to climate disruptions (or world war 3) and where people are moving to.

US companies will continue to dominate for many decades to come. Most of the worlds greatest companies came from the US and will continue to do so. I do seek exposure to emerging markets, but I am going to chose these even more carefully going forward with an eye on geopolitical risks.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>AI and Tech<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>AI and Tech are other fields that I believe will continue to flourish and dominate in the years to come. Humans want progress and they love technology and knowledge. None of this can be stopped.In terms of AI and Tech, this may also be a time to invest in defense industry tech that will be used to push back on rogue states and actions should it come to world war 3, or just war. Raytheon has been a favorite dividend player for quite some time.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quality Bonds<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The raging 20&#8217;s all about risk management and diversification of assets. We will win some and lose some. But volatility can historically be smoothed out using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/retirement\/asset-allocation-models\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quality bond allocations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>More Cash<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It is never a bad idea to have some percentage of assets in cold hard cash. Now with inflation running so hot, and fears of world war 3 \u00a0this became tricky because money sitting in low interest rate cash accounts loses purchasing power quickly. But, inflation should hopefully continue to smooth into next year and having cash has many advantages. For one, cash gives you opportunity. It is opportunity in an unmanifesred potential to jump on market dips and pick up assets on sale.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reduce Costs and Debt<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I think we need to get used to l<a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/01\/declutter-finances-build-wealth\/\" target=\"_blank\">iving more simply<\/a> over the next decade. And in many ways I believe this will be good for our health, our communities and our future. There may be significant supply chain disruptions as large countries jockey for position. But we should ask ourselves, did we really need all the throw away stuff to begin with?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How Are You Preparing for World War 3?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Please share other ways we can prepare for geo political turbulence over the next 10 years.
