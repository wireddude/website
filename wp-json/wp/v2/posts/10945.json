I enjoy learning about <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Warren Buffett and emulating some of his success. He is an American icon. I also like owning a small slice of<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">\u00a0his vast holding company <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Berkshire Hathaway and the corresponding stock BRK-B.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">If I was to hold one stock beyond an S&amp;P 500 Index fund ETF, it would be Berkshire. I do not study Warren Buffett because I could ever be a great stock picker (none of us should get too fancy pants in this area), but because reading about his habits can help me become a better investor, business person and human. Here are some of the main investing tips I have learned from Warren Buffett:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><strong>Invest early and often in low cost index funds that are balanced to meet my specific goals and risk tolerance.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>When good quality company stocks or the broader market goes on &#8220;sale&#8221; or down in value, think of this as a good thing and buy some. When something I want goes on sale I want to buy it at that point! Harness the power of dollar cost averaging.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Have a clear, simple strategy for building wealth over time. No short term gimmicks or get rich quick, just good old fashioned building of wealth one brick at a time.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Understand and harness the power of compounding by investing early, often and letting dividends reinvest and ride.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Have long term faith in America, yes we always face some kind of challenge, but it is still the best system in the world and we are always working to make it better. Good solid American companies and the American people have a bright future for a long time to come. We still have the secret sauce of strong institutions, free markets, law, property rights and a culture of innovation and can do spirit&#8230;<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t try to beat the market or wall street.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Who is the man?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Berkshire the company is like an amazing collection of over 60 awesome American companies. <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">I admire the man himself for his morals, intellect and values. <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">I find him to be a role model in terms of living a good <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">and fulfilling <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">life. <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">He values integrity, family, moral <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">judgment<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"> and strategic business investments. He loves numbers and math. He also <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">loves<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"> a Dairy Queen Blizzard and burger! <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">His investing wisdom seems to me to go beyond investing itself. Here are some of his great quotes full of wisdom we could all learn from:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">\u201cSomeone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"s5\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s4\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">\u201c<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s4\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">We select such investments on a long-term basis, weighing the same factors as would be involved in the purchase of 100% of an operating business:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">(1) favorable long-term economic characteristics;<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">(2) competent and honest management;<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">(3) purchase price attractive when measured against the yardstick of value to a private owner; and<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">(4) an industry with which we are familiar and whose long-term business characteristics we feel competent to judge.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">&#8220;There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don\u2019t like because you think it will look good on your resume. Isn\u2019t that a little like saving up sex for your old age?\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">&#8220;Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s3\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">&#8220;Imagine that you had a car and that was the only car you\u2019d have for your entire lifetime. Of course, you\u2019d care for it well, changing the oil more frequently than necessary, driving carefully, etc. Now, consider that you only have one mind and one body. Prepare them for life, care for them. You can enhance your mind over time. A person\u2019s main asset is themselves, so preserve and enhance yourself.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Warren Buffett &#8211; BRK-B<\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">I admire the company <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">(BRK-<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">B) <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">and the stock for how it adds value to my personal wealth and assets. Sure, it may not return the stellar returns we have seen forever, but it is still a strong collection of assets that will return value over the long run. As we discuss here at The Money Vikings, in order to build wealth, one will need to generally acquire assets and reduce <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">liabilities. In terms of acquiring assets, one of the best asset classes over the years has been investing consistently in high quality stocks as part of a diversified index fund. There are many ways to do this through Vanguard or others. Another way we enjoy is by following the lead of Berkshire and buying either class B shares or shares of some of the companies Berkshire is heavily invested in.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">AN INVESTMENT GIANT WE CAN ALL OWN<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Mr. Buffett <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">has built Berkshire Hathaway into a very powerful giant in ter<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">ms of investment value. There are class B shares, <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">class B are the <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">\u201c<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">middle class<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">\u201d<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"> accessible shares, the class A shares sell for about $318,000\/share, as oppose<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">d to class B that sell for about $212\/share.<\/span><\/span> <span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Owning class B shares <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">is like owning a small slice of some of the most powerful American companies<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"> and the strong American economy<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">,<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"> adding value and selling products around the world. The company is comprised of a diversified portfolio of over 60 subsidiaries. It includes insurance operations, furniture, energy, BNSF railroad, GEICO (Government Executive Insurance Company), Fruit of the Loom, Dairy Queen, etc. etc. The company holds massive stakes in Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and Apple just to name a few.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">A FOREVER STOCK FOR WARREN BUFFETT?<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">For me personally, BRK-B (Berkshire Class B) shares are a buy and hold forever stock (or at least a very long time). Even when Warren Buffett passes onto the next life, I believe Berkshire will have a prosperous future. Large shareholders and institutions will insist on BRK staying true to core values that have stood the test of time. It is like owning a well maintained and managed mutual fund that gives investors a slice of some of the greatest companies ever. These are companies that will continue to develop new and innovative products, drive efficiencies and add value to customers and investors. As long as future Berkshire management sticks to Mr. Buffett\u2019s conservative value based approach to investing, the company will do just fine.<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"> The 21% annualized returns that Berkshire has enjoyed on average since the 1960\u2019s may not be as high forever, but hey I would be satisfied with a third of that return year in and year out.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ANNUAL LETTER<\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Warren Buffett is famous for his annual letter to shareholders and really the world of investors. It is a down to earth folksy explanation of all things investing and what is on his mind. I absolutely love it and really makes investing make sense. This is opposite the talking heads screaming at each other on the nightly business and economic roundup shows.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are some early highlights from past letters to shareholders:<\/p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><strong>High fees! Once again he warns that many Americans are being fleeced by high fees by &#8220;financial professionals.&#8221; In other words, they are taking our profits for adding very little value. In fact he made a bet that a low cost index fund just sitting for 10 years would beat the most fancy pants &#8220;financial helpers.&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>I did a brief stint in the financial industry right after college, and quite frankly I could sense it. Nothing against the finance profession, but the fees are too high and they are &#8220;taking&#8221; money that should go back to the investors. Remember you are working for your money, not anyone else.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>Warren Buffett says &#8220;performance comes and performance goes, but fees never falter.&#8221;<\/li>\r\n<li>He talks about the risks inherent in bonds. He says if one has a long term investing horizon, high grade bonds can increase risk.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Berkshire stockpile of cash is at a huge $116 BILLION. He talks about using the cash for acquisitions, highlighting a necessary component of a &#8220;sensible purchase price.&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>He mentions that the Berkshire stock has dropped before and could again. Debt free investors can take advantage of these dips.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A few highlights to remember from 2016:<\/p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>He clarified his stance on holding investments forever, he basically says we have every right to sell investments if it is time. But he still likes to hold for a VERY long time.<\/li>\r\n<li>He did not mention much about Apple although it was one of the largest Berkshire buys in 2017, owning about 61 million shares or 1.1% of the company.<\/li>\r\n<li>From Warren Buffett on the Vanguard Group founder Jack Bogle, a statue should be erected of him for what he did for the average investor in America.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Here are a few of the companies that Berkshire is heavily invested in and owns significant stakes. This simply serves a sampling of the types of strong companies in various industries, which makes BRK-B an attractive long term investment:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">1.

Everything from toasters to cars will be connected and constantly communicating and upgrading via improved software for improved performance and sensing. We now have the introduction of motion sensors, smart speakers and electronic weigh scales, thermostats and thermometers. In the next 10 years, we will see the number of <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s10\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">IoT<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s10\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"> devices grow, which theoretically will result in greater safety, security and health.

Not all are rosy about Apple\u2019s future. This space faces extreme competition and it can be hard for companies like this to continue innovating in the same way. I mean, what more can these smart phones do that they don\u2019t already do? This will probably be viewed as a silly question someday when these things integrate with our biological being and do everything for us.

Right now, Oracle is clearly battling it out for number four with IBM and SAP, well behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. <span class=\"s11\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">Warren Buffett likes!<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">8<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">.

Most think COST only gets by due to its membership fees.\u00a0That thinking is true in the near term but it\u2019s missing the big picture.\u00a0COST is able to keep paying generous special dividends.\u00a0Shares are a strong buy for the long run. Costco is most well known for their discounts but as a stock, it is known as being mainly about membership fees. With membership fees arguably being the difference between profitability and, well, non-profitability, it would appear as if membership fees form the essence of the growth thesis. Shares are a strong buy and one you\u2019ll want to keep for the long run. Costco is another one of those companies that even during a recession, or even more so, people will want to shop there. <span class=\"s11\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">Warren Buffett likes!<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are many great books and resources that teach someone about Warren Buffett.
