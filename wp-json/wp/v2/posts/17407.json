For whatever reason, millions of people never stop to analyze their behavior or think about ways they can improve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First let talk about Habits. Money Vikings emphasize<a href=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/05\/habits-of-the-rich\/\"> habits in many of our posts, for a big reason.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It typically does not matter that much what we do once or twice as long as it is not catastrophic. It matters what we do again and again with out even thinking about it. So, with that, here are 7 habits that will make you more powerful than 95% of all people:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-be-conscientious-7-habits-1\"><strong>1. Be Conscientious<\/strong> (7 habits #1)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be surprised to learn that having conscientiousness as a strong character trait was a leading indicator of ones ability to live a long healthy life. Most people initially guess some specific diet or exercise regiment. But turns out that having a high degree of conscientiousness leads to better and longer health outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being careful or diligent. This is the habit of being thoughtful in our words, actions and responses to life. Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to disorderly or sloppy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense that conscientious traits would lead to better to human health and success outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"226\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/free-photo-of-a-dog-sitting-on-top-of-a-mountain-with-a-green-background-226x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17423\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/free-photo-of-a-dog-sitting-on-top-of-a-mountain-with-a-green-background-226x300.jpeg 226w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/free-photo-of-a-dog-sitting-on-top-of-a-mountain-with-a-green-background-770x1024.jpeg 770w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/free-photo-of-a-dog-sitting-on-top-of-a-mountain-with-a-green-background-768x1021.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/free-photo-of-a-dog-sitting-on-top-of-a-mountain-with-a-green-background.jpeg 1128w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-develop-healthy-sleep-habits-7-habits-2\"><strong>2.

More and more research is proving that good sleep hygiene leads to better life results all around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_20349\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/m2SVFx2mOEg?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-control-social-media-or-it-will-control-you\"><strong>3. Control Social Media or it Will Control You<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Silcon Valley overlords have made social media and our <a href=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/02\/robinhood-investing-addiction\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6072\">phones a drug<\/a>, pure and simple. We are collectively spending way too much time in front of screens. I fear this will negatively impact our children and the very foundation of human contentment and <a href=\"https:\/\/gretchenrubin.com\/books\/the-happiness-project\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">happiness<\/a>. Sure, technology is amazing and adds so much value to our lives. Money Viking readers and watchers know that we generally support technology. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But think about all the time spent scrolling that could be used more productively in your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_13462\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/W6CBb3yX9Zs?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-create-or-own-something\"><strong>4. Create or Own Something<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To rise above and build a future of True Wealth I am convinced you must create something or own something. I use these terms loosely and do not mean you need to paint the next Mona Lisa or own a Fortune 500 company. What I mean is that you need to find a way that you are adding value through creating something. This could be through a small business, hobby, learning to be an effective parent, learning a skill you can do for others or yourself. There are thousands of unique ways to be creative. Find some of yours and share them with the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And connected to this is the concept of owning something. Owning your work product, a piece of property, a stock, bond, a small business, a website, a coffee cart. Anything, owning something allows you to learn how to profit from it while adding value to other lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-think-about-health-daily\"><strong>5. Think About Health Daily<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not into all or nothing health concepts. I do not believe there is a perfect, but there is the ability to raise your awareness or consciousness about health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_51892\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/BCN9119oHSg?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-develop-a-healthy-relationship-w-money\"><strong>6. Develop a Healthy Relationship w\/ Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Money management and building wealth vexes most people. Most people are simply not good at managing their assets or income. This was a main reason we developed the Money Viking blog, YouTube channel and our book. Simply put, if you want to do better than 95% of all people, really learn how to manage your money and set up automated systems for success. The biggest one being to make sure to invest or save a small part of each and every paycheck. This will add up to large sums over time and build passive income machines for the second part of your life journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-amazon wp-block-embed-amazon\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Conquer Financial Freedom: Living a Life of True Wealth\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"550\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https:\/\/read.amazon.com\/kp\/card?preview=inline&#038;linkCode=kpd&#038;ref_=k4w_oembed_huaFa9MKbxeKmK&#038;asin=B0BRJW92XV&#038;tag=kpembed-20\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-keep-learning\"><strong>7.

But we can commit to learning more and improving skills throughout our lives. And when I say learning I am not just talking about information. I am talking about a combination of information and wisdom. Wisdom is what truly takes us to higher levels of consciousness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What if there were 7 habits &nbsp;you could do that would make you more successful at life than 95% of people.
