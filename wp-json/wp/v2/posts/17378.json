Clearly successful in business and wealth building. A key architect of current day Berkshire-Hathaway. But every time I saw him speak or learned more about him, I felt just a little bit wiser for it. But not just wiser in investing, but wiser about this life as a human. If you look deeper into his famous quotes, he was really talking about the human condition and much more beyond dollars and cents. I really grew to love the guys as a grandfather type figure even though I never knew him personally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"charlie-munger-honesty-candor\"><strong>Charlie Munger: Honesty &amp; Candor<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of the things I loved about <a href=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/05\/charlie-munger-6-simple-rules-for-life\/\">Charlie<\/a> was his honest candor. He was a person that collected information, thought hard about it and then formed his own view that he would share. This is not always the case in life. Most people just accept the common view of things. <a href=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/2023\/03\/charlie-mungers-sage-advice\/\">Charlie<\/a> seemed adept at focusing in on something and then finding a straightforward way to address it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"soldier-on\"><strong>Soldier On<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlie had more than his fair share of horse shit thrown his way through life, including some major tragedies. He also experienced great opportunities. But either way he seemed to just soldier on and have an ethos of getting up each day and doing the best he could. This is what we can do as people, get up each day and give life our best shot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bless your soul Charlie and thank you for all the wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"caas-yvideo-wrapper yvideo caas-hero caas-cover caas-yvideo-elem\" data-video-index=\"0\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"caas-yvideo caas-yvideo-top caas-yvideo-rendered\" data-videoconfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:true,&quot;duration&quot;:0,&quot;height&quot;:360,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;pageSpaceId&quot;:&quot;1183306728&quot;,&quot;queryParams&quot;:null,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;finance&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{},&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/charlie-munger-speaks-daily-journal-162005167.html?format=embed&amp;region=US&amp;lang=en-US&amp;site=finance&amp;player_autoplay=1&amp;expName=y20&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:{&quot;raw&quot;:null}},&quot;YVAP&quot;:{&quot;accountId&quot;:&quot;145&quot;},&quot;playlistUI&quot;:{&quot;playlistId&quot;:&quot;finance-videotron&quot;},&quot;expName&quot;:&quot;y20&quot;,&quot;playlist&quot;:{&quot;mediaItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;998321df-fe6c-3bdc-b305-b60327ca46f3&quot;}],&quot;videoRecommendations&quot;:true,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;finance-videotron&quot;},&quot;videoAlias&quot;:&quot;charlie-munger-speaks-daily-journal-162005167&quot;,&quot;hidePlaylist&quot;:true,&quot;comscoreC4&quot;:&quot;US Finance&quot;,&quot;pageUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/memorable-quotes-from-berkshire-hathaways-charlie-munger-225308303.html&quot;,&quot;referrerUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com&quot;,&quot;videoPosition&quot;:&quot;top&quot;,&quot;articleUuid&quot;:&quot;3ef5e34f-7570-488d-83de-5f249f91e1cd&quot;,&quot;pct&quot;:&quot;storywithleadvideo&quot;,&quot;expBucket&quot;:&quot;HPMODALMAST100,FPSATE101,FPDOGFOOD202,fin-classic-optin-nov&quot;,&quot;expBucketName&quot;:&quot;HPMODALMAST100,FPSATE101,FPDOGFOOD202,fin-classic-optin-nov&quot;,&quot;pblob&quot;:&quot;revsp:yahoofinance.com;lpstaid:3ef5e34f-7570-488d-83de-5f249f91e1cd;pt:content;pd:modal;ver:ydotcom;lu:0;pct:story&quot;}\">\n<div class=\"player has-background evp-docked-mode\">\n<div class=\"evp-main evp-docked evp-docked-fadein\">\n<div class=\"evp-docked-close-button\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"evp-docked-bg\">\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"evp-docked-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kH2D_6YPK9hNL6snGbVy2g--~B\/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MDY7dz03MjI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2021-02\/d247fa50-779f-11eb-8f75-f5c5b060fa61\" alt=\"Charlie Munger Speaks at Daily Journal AGM\"><\/figure><p><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"evp-docked-overlay\">&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"caas-attr caas-attr-authors\">\n<div class=\"caas-attr-meta\">\n<h2 class=\"caas-attr-time-style\"><strong>Here are some great Munger quotes that can be life altering:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"caas-body\">\n<h2><strong>Charlie Munger, <\/strong><strong>On life:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u201cI think life is a whole series of opportunity costs.

And a related thought: Early on, write your desired obituary \u2014 and then behave accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 If you don\u2019t care whether you are rational or not, you won\u2019t work on it. Then you will stay irrational and get lousy results.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Patience can be learned. Having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one thing for a long time is a huge advantage.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You can learn a lot from dead people. Read of the deceased you admire and detest.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Don\u2019t bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 A great company keeps working after you are not; a mediocre company won\u2019t do that.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"caas-figure\">\n<div class=\"caas-figure-with-pb\">\n<div>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview caas-loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ny\/api\/res\/1.2\/UfsarOFeHZfliHAWcrmRQQ--\/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ4MQ--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2021-02\/7333c230-776b-11eb-b7f7-0f70bf95dd7f\" alt=\"Warren Buffett (L) and Berkshire-Hathaway partner Charlie Munger address members of the press May 5, 2002 in Omaha, Nebraska.

We seek out good long-term investments and stubbornly hold them for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Ben Graham said, &#8216;Day to day, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term it\u2019s a weighing machine.&#8217; If you keep making something more valuable, then some wise person is going to notice it and start buying.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 There is no such thing as a 100% sure thing when investing. Thus, the use of leverage is dangerous. A string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero. Don\u2019t count on getting rich twice.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You don\u2019t, however, need to own a lot of things in order to get rich.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor. When the world changes, you must change.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Warren and I hated railroad stocks for decades, but the world changed and finally the country had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy. We were slow to recognize the change, but better late than never.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Finally, I will add two short sentences by Charlie that have been his decision-clinchers for decades: &#8216;Warren, think more about it. You\u2019re smart and I\u2019m right.&#8217;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What was it about Charlie Munger? Clearly successful in business and wealth building.

If you look deeper into his famous quotes, he was really talking about the human condition and much more beyond dollars and cents.
