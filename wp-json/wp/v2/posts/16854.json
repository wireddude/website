Money Vikings have been blogging about our True Wealth investing journey since 2017. And those that have read a few of my posts may know that I have been the <strong><em>anti-meme stock too the moon guy <\/em><\/strong>for a long time. I consider myself a classic investor. I want to own quality companies over the long run and practice fundamental wealth building methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_80426\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bmr8YmwnZ3w?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok, maybe I am boring, but it sure damn works. Budgeting, delayed gratification, owning more asserts than liabilities and investing for the long run in quality assets does a funny thing: It build wealth and leads to financial freedom!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enter-realty-income\"><strong>Enter Realty Income<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was first introduced to this Realty Income company back when my beloved grandfather was still in human form with us. One day about a decade ago he handed me a short article clipped from a newspaper. It mentioned high quality investments to consider and one was ticker &#8220;O&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I started researching it, the more I liked. San Diego based, sound business model supported by real income producing assets, well managed and hey, they even send a dividend each month so you feel like a mini landlord.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started and never looked back. So as you can imagine as Realty Income stock hits 52 week lows, I am adding to the position at these levels and juicing that dividend yield of almost 6%!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-money-vikings wp-block-embed-money-vikings\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/blond-pigeon.pikapod.net\/2023\/02\/my-wow-stocks-for-2023\/\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"top-5-reasons-im-buying-realty-income\"><strong>Top 5 reasons I&#8217;m Buying Realty Incom<\/strong>e<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates a diversified portfolio of commercial properties.

Consistent dividend growth<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Realty Income has paid out a monthly dividend since 1969 and has increased its dividend every quarter for the past 99 quarters.

Strong portfolio of properties<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason I&#8217;m buying Realty Income is that Realty Income owns a diversified portfolio of over 12,000 properties in 49 states and Puerto Rico. The company&#8217;s properties are leased to a variety of tenants, including investment-grade companies and essential businesses. This diversification helps to reduce Realty Income&#8217;s risk and provides a steady stream of income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-strong-credit-rating\">3. Strong credit rating<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Realty Income has an investment-grade credit rating of A. This gives the company access to low-cost capital, which it uses to grow its portfolio and acquire new properties. This is another reason I&#8217;m Buying Reality Income. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-experienced-management-team\">4. Experienced management team<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Realty Income has a management team with a deep understanding of the real estate industry and a proven track record of success. The company&#8217;s management team is focused on long-term growth and profitability. This is another reason I&#8217;m Buying Reality Income. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-favorable-long-term-trends\">5. Favorable long-term trends<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Realty Income is well-positioned to benefit from several long-term trends, including the aging population, the growth of e-commerce, and the increasing urbanization of the world&#8217;s population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Realty Income is a great long-term investment for investors who are looking for a reliable dividend payer with a strong portfolio of properties and an experienced management team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some additional reasons why Realty Income is an exciting investment:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The company is expanding into new markets, such as Europe and South America.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Realty Income is investing in new technologies, such as solar energy and self-storage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The company is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of e-commerce.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a long-term investment that can help you achieve your financial goals, Realty Income is a great option to consider.
