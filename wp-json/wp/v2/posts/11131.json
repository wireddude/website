But those nice stable investment returns and appreciation of capital are sure nice, it is like the demand cannot keep up with supply when it comes to real estate. But if you do not want to respond to maintenance calls, have you heard of a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)? This article will talk all about REITs and compare them to traditional &#8220;hands on&#8221; real estate investing.<\/p>\n<p>I write a lot about <a href=\"https:\/\/themoneyvikings.net\/2018\/12\/15\/analyzing-a-real-estate-investment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate<\/a> because I have a passion for it as a thing and as an investment vehicle. It may have something to do with my arts background, but I enjoy a well designed and well maintained property. Think about how essential real estate is to our modern lives. It keeps us safe, healthy and provides a platform for some of our greatest family memories. It is the grocery store, mall, coffee shop, warehouse, office complex, fast food joint, pharmacy, etc. Real estate in general is an excellent asset class in many ways. But it is important to consider all the pros and cons of the different ways to invest in real estate. <strong>In this article we focus on one that can be very easy to enter and easy to manage, high quality real estate investment trusts, or REITs<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is a REIT?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Slow and steady often times wins the race!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A REIT is a company that owns and in many cases operates income producing real estate. An investor can buy shares of these companies. In other words, a REIT is a pool of properties and mortgages bundled together. The company offers shares of these combined assets in the form of a security or stock that an individual can buy into. There are all kinds of REITs that specialize in different types of real estate including office\/commercial, apartment buildings\/housing, hospitals, shopping centers, hotels, etc. REITs were invented as a real estate vehicle under a Public Law signed by President Eisenhower. REITs give all investors access to large scale real estate development investing.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>IRS Rule on Income<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One really neat feature of REITs is that IRS rules require the company to pay out 90% of their income back to share unit holders. This is typically in the form of a dividend. Dividend income is one of several strategies Money Vikings are harnessing to reach FI, so this makes REITs an ideal investment vehicle.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>REIT vs. Hands On Real Estate Ownership<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We are going to run some numbers and look at the pros and cons of owning\/investing in REIT&#8217;s vs actual hands on real estate investment ownership. The result may surprise you:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Real Estate Investment<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you invest in a $500,000 investment property (single family home) in a nice middle class neighborhood. You put $100,000 down and finance the remaining $400,000. In this scenario it is important to remember that your actual investment is $100,000.<\/p>\n<p>On a $400,000 mortgage the total cost of principle, interest (4-5%), escrow for taxes, would be about $2,500\/month<\/p>\n<p>Add another $100\/month for landscaping and another $100\/month for deferred maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>The house would cost about $2,700\/month in expenses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BOTTOMLINE:\u00a0If you look at the rental market and let\u2019s say the property would rent for about $3,100\/month. <span class=\"s2\">So a person would be looking at a $400\/month cash flow \u201cprofit\u201d.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, keep in mind that this investment takes a lot of hands on care and feeding: There will be maintenance calls to respond to at off hours. Changes of occupancy to manage, advertising, screening tenants, contracts to negotiate and sign. Long term maintenance to manage. Minor and major repairs, etc.<\/p>\n<p>But on the other hand, over many years you will be building equity in the property. So as the $400k note is drawn down and the price appreciates at 3-5% annually, the value of that investment can grow from the original $100k to $200k, $300k, etc.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s analyze a $100,000 investment in a REIT. A very popular and strong REIT is the company Realty Income, ticker symbol \u201cO\u201d which we have written about before. With $100,000 you could by 1,538 shares of \u201cO\u201d at $65\/share. The stock offers a 4% dividend yield. One really neat thing that I love about \u201cO\u201d is that they pay the dividend monthly, which makes it feel like a traditional real estate investment. Each share returns .221\/share per month.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"s2\">BOTTOMLINE: .221 x 1,538 shares = $340\/month cash<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> flow<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All this with no calls in the middle of the night due to a leaky roof!<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span class=\"s2\">Bottomline<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s2\">As you can see from this simplified example, the investment in a high quality Real Estate Investment Trust can offer some comparable returns and cash flow. <\/span>The REIT investment certainly has far less \u201cheadaches\u201d in terms of day to day management. All investing holds some level of risk. The company could tank and the shares lose value. On the other hand, investing in physical real estate you manage has its fair share of risks. A major repair could certainly set you back at almost any time.<\/p>\n<p>I like working with both REIT\u2019s and traditional real estate. But for someone that does not want to deal with Tenants, contracts, repairs and hands on management, REIT is the way to gain exposure to the real estate sector. And looking at some of the initial numbers, may provide many of the returns and pure financial results.\u00a0Ideally the value of the REIT shares will rise just as the underlying value of any real estate asset will rise.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>a few MORE examples of quality top of the line REIT\u2019s that many profit from:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2 class=\"s3\"><strong><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">National Retail Properties \u201c<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">NNN<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"s3\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">Another widely touted and strong REIT is National Retail Properties.

In fact, the cash flow that can be generated from a sizable investment in high quality REIT&#8217;s can spin off some significant income. REIT&#8217;s are a great alternative that have now stood the test of time and can be an ideal vehicle for those searching for passive income. Yes, the industry will continue to manage and weather disruption, but that has always been the case as consumers priorities and desires shift. A good company anticipates and prepares for these changes and shifts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Consider these REITS as an alternative to investing in physical real estate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":11242,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[12,16,22],"tags":[41,78,83,90,114,143,146,159,160,161,162,164,190,191],"class_list":["post-11131","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-free","category-investing","category-real-estate","tag-best-way-to-invest-in-real-estate","tag-dividends","tag-easy-way-to-invest-in-real-estate","tag-federal-realty-investment-trust","tag-invest-in-real-estate-with-little-money","tag-nnn","tag-o","tag-real-estate-cash-flow","tag-real-estate-investing","tag-real-estate-investment-trusts","tag-realty-income","tag-reits","tag-stor-capital","tag-store-capital"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pexels-photo-1370704.jpeg","jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11131","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=11131"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11131\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/11242"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11131"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=11131"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=11131"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
