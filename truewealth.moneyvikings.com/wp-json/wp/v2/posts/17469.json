This event took place in the 2nd century BCE, after the Maccabean Revolt, a successful rebellion against the Seleucid Empire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hanukkah\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hanukkah\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hanukkah<\/a> begins with the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king who outlawed Jewish religious practices. He also desecrated the Second Temple, dedicating it to the Greek god Zeus. In response, a group of Jewish rebels led by Judah Maccabee launched a revolt against the Seleucids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/img_9739-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/img_9739-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/img_9739-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/img_9739-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/img_9739-1-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years of fighting, the Maccabees defeated the Seleucids and recaptured Jerusalem. They then rededicated the Second Temple, which had been damaged during the war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to legend, the Maccabees found only enough oil to light the temple&#8217;s menorah for one day. However, the oil miraculously lasted for eight days, giving the Jews time to prepare a new supply of oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Hanukkah is celebrated by lighting candles on a menorah, one candle for each day of the holiday.
