The majority are simple <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2022\/01\/covered-calls-ford-motors\/\" target=\"_blank\">covered calls<\/a>. The rest are more neutral iron condors. I\u2019ve been recently doing more calendars for earnings as well. I won\u2019t go over 3 or 4 more \u201ccomplex\u201d trades at any given time. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time I like to sell premium over buy it because the probability of success is more in my favor. I realize the risk\/reward isn\u2019t as great buying a long call, but I usually try to enter trades with a 75% or higher probability of making 50% of the credit I initially received.  For example if I entered an iron condor for $100 in credit, I would look to close it for a $50 debit around 21 days before expiration. This leaves me with a $50 in profit. It&#8217;s fairly easy to repeat options strategy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"greg-how-much-buying-power-do-you-typically-use\">Greg: How much Buying Power  do you typically use?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry: I typically use around 50% of the available stock buying power. When I go over that, I start looking to take trades off when I can. It&#8217;s a simple risk management &#8220;sleep at night&#8221; options strategy I use to keep my sanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"greg-are-you-long-or-short-the-market\">Greg: Are you long or short the market?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry: Currently I\u2019m long but not by design. My beta weighted delta (using SPY as my underlying) is about 47. I\u2019d like it to be neutral but I\u2019m holding some stock there that is pulling up the delta by about 27. Subtracting that out it\u2019s 20 and I am trying to only add bearish positions until I get to 0. But if there\u2019s a good opportunity in something that makes me longer or neutral in this market, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily turn it down. So that&#8217;s my options strategy for being long vs short. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"greg-you-mentioned-covered-calls-how-are-you-trading-i-them\">Greg: You mentioned covered calls, how are you trading I them?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry: For my options strategy, I usually buy 30-45 day 30 delta short calls. They seem to be the best risk reward in my opinion. (70% POP). I don\u2019t always roll them right away. Sometimes I buy to close the current month but don\u2019t roll to the next month until the premium and IVR% is high enough to warrant doing the actual trade. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-money-vikings wp-block-embed-money-vikings\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttp:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2022\/01\/covered-calls-ford-motors\/\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"greg-have-you-had-stock-called-away-before\">Greg: Have you had stock called away before?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry: Yes it\u2019s not a big deal and you should only enter a covered call in a stock you don\u2019t mind selling. Reasons you might not want to sell a covered call against a stock : <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Your short call is below your cost basis (avoid this in the first place).  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. You would suffer large tax consequences for selling the actual stock. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The stock is rallying and why would you want to limit your profits on something like that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. You are about to get paid a nice dividend <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Earnings are coming out next week and there could be amazing news for your stock. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. The ex-dividend date is coming up and you would like to participate in the next dividend distribution. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_37994\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/BDTRSIF3OqI?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"greg-which-brokerage-do-to-use-for-all-this\">Greg: Which brokerage do to use for all this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry: I use TastyTrade.
