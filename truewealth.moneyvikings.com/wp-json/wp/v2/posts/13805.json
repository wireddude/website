Today we are at Greed. Tomorrow will hit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/markets\/fear-and-greed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Extreme Greed<\/a>? These charts at first seem very silly. You may wonder if they come from some completely sill reader&#8217;s poll that is biased in some way.
