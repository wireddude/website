I use a particular portfolio allocation so my finances can weather many storms, and a key factor here is harnessing the power of dividends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-papa-buffett-strong\"><strong>Papa Buffett<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I share many of the dividend allocations I use, let&#8217;s turn to Warren Buffett himself. Buffett is arguably one of the world&#8217;s greatest investors and guess what, he loves dividends. In fact, one of Buffett&#8217;s keys to outperforming in turbulent times is to harness the power of dividends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-dividend-overview-strong\"><strong>Dividend Overview<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A dividend is a simple concept. Basically a company sends some it&#8217;s profits directly back to shareholders. For each share of stock in a particular company, that share pays a certain dividend. It is also critical to understand the dividend yield. The yield is a percentage that compares the current share price to the amount of the dividend. If the share price is low and dividend high, then the percentage yield is high. This can give an investor a sense of initial return on investment trough solely the dividend payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-no-need-to-sell-strong\"><strong>No Need to Sell<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing I suspect Mr. Buffett likes about dividends stocks is that you do not need to sell the underlying asset in order to profit from it. This can be a problem with many assets. If the only time you can profit is when you sell, you could have a lot of capital tied up in an investment and it can become more difficult to grow wealth. With a strong dividend focused portfolio you can reap rewards along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-small-amounts-require-several-approaches-strong\"><strong>Small Amounts Require Several Approaches<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, the actual amount that comes from dividends on a modest investment account is rather small. Most of us are not Buffett and Munger collecting billions in dividends as part of Berkshire Hathaway Stock. And surprisingly, Buffetts own holding company does not send out a dividend. He prefers to pile up the cash to buy more great businesses, which is not necessarily a bad thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-health-check-strong\"><strong>Health Check<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A dividend can be a sign of company health. If a company can consistently pay a dividend it is proving to the world that it can make a profit through many different kinds of economic environments. This is a big reason I prefer dividend aristocrats. These are companies that paid a dividend consecutively for over 25 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-building-ride-my-bike-portfolios-strong\"><strong>Building &#8220;Ride My Bike&#8221; Portfolios<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_14034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-14034\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-14034\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/mikkel-bech-yjafnkltky0-unsplash-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"dividend\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-14034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@bechbox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mikkel Bech<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/?utm_source=true-wealth&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_28972\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EIDovNzCtJU?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some call them &#8220;All Weather Portfolios&#8221;, I like to call it a &#8220;Ride My Bike&#8221; portfolio. This is a portfolio that can be built and let ride for a while without a bunch of messing with it on a daily basis. I would rather not spend all day watching stock charts and fretting over my investments. In fact, I would rather ride my bike, make art, spend time with my family and friends and play games. Therefore for over a decade I have built, developed and tested out what I am now calling my &#8220;Ride My Bike&#8221; portfolio. This a variation of a sleep at night portfolio or no worries portfolio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a regular reader of TMV and listen to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/moneyvikings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcast<\/a>, you may know that we are continually look for ways to set investing and passive income on autopilot. This way we can spend our time doing what we want to do, and if we want to engage with our investments that is our choice, not out of necessity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-multiple-storms-strong\"><strong>Multiple Storms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In our investing journey we have seen our fair share of &#8220;storms&#8221;: Dot com bust, 9\/11, Great Recession, housing bubble, Covid-19, etc. &nbsp;And this portfolio allocation has actually done remarkably well through it all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In this article we present a portfolio allocation that we believe does well in multiple environments over the long run.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We loosely base our portfolio on the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3H3Pgfa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ray Dalio &#8220;All Weather&#8221; portfolio<\/a>, with some adjustments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We seek a balance between common asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, etc., and leave a little room for speculative and prudent risk taking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This is not individual investment advice. All investing has inherent risk, seek the advice of a fiduciary financial professional. Everyone\u2019s risk tolerance and stage in life is different.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-you-dont-need-to-pick-stocks-strong\"><strong>You don&#8217;t need to pick stocks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\" target=\"_blank\">Money Vikings<\/a> do enjoy looking into individual stocks and buying a few shares. But this is maybe 10% at most of our portfolios. We mainly keep it all very simple plain vanilla low cost index funds and bonds funds that often pay dividends. We generally follow the allocations supported by Ray Dalio and&nbsp;Jack Bogle creator of Vanguard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-a-pyramid-of-strength-strong\"><strong>A Pyramid of Strength<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A portfolio can be thought of like a pyramid. The bottom foundation could be exposure to a strong foundation of quality low cost stock and bond index funds. Maybe some cash for emergencies and opportunities. In the middle of the pyramid could be exposure to real estate. The top may be a small amount of exposure to Individual stocks or other risky asset classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry wrote about how past returns in different asset classes are no guarantee of future outcomes. In fact, it seems very difficult to predict future returns in this class or that. Therefore, I hear many people I talk with tell me how confusing it all is. And the financial industry seems to have made it confusing by design in order to charge us high fees and support fancy job titles. As mentioned, my sleep at night portfolio is loosely based on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lazyportfolioetf.com\/allocation\/ray-dalio-all-weather\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ray Dalio \u201call weather\u201d portfolio<\/a>. Ray\u2019s portfolio is designed to do well in all types of environments, during booms and busts, etc. One of the main differences is that I do not do much with gold. Mainly because I do not understand it, it does not produce a product and Warren Buffett doesn&#8217;t like it, that is my rationale.&nbsp;For me personally, I am dividing investments into various categories, asset classes or buckets as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-s-amp-p-500-amp-other-index-funds-30-strong\"><strong>S&amp;P 500 &amp; Other Index Funds (30%)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>30% of my portfolio is invested in a low cost index fund that is made up of 500 large to medium high quality US companies. 100 million people in the US own some shares of these companies. &nbsp;Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index is a good example of this kind of exposure. here are the sectors and the top 10 holdings as an idea of what this diversified fund invests in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-vdadx-big-daddy-of-dividend-investing-strong\"><strong>VDADX (Big Daddy of Dividend Investing)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different kinds of low expense Vanguard funds and exchange traded funds that offer exposure to a broad array of great American companies. <strong>For example the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Fund VDADX holds positions in strong companies like Microsoft, Visa, AT&amp;T, etc. Another one I find strong is the Vanguard Equity Income fund VEIPX.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, owning this type of investment is an investment in the greatness of our country. I do not know of any other country in the world that has produced so many strong companies with so much value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the economy will go up and down during normal cycles and other strange things will happen. But chances are many of these companies are going to be just fine over the coming decades. They will continue to spin off customer value and shareholder value through their diverse products and services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And owning equity in these companies as part of a fund manages your risk levels. Chances are a few of the great companies will go through rough patches, but there is a very small chance they all go down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ADDED BONUS: Do not forget to ROTH.

Let&#8217;s say your research indicates that the energy sector is prepped for a rebound. Instead of taking the risk of choosing an individual stock, a person could invest in sector ETF&#8217;s. For example the iShares ETF&#8217;s or SPDR Select Sector Funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I deploy and utilize these often when I want to add exposure to a certain meta theme such as energy, real estate, healthcare, financial services, technology etc. For more information I research the iShares funds and others:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FROM THE iShares approach:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"w1521942788732\" class=\"ls-cmp-wrap\">\n<div id=\"c1521942788732\" class=\"iw_component\">\n<div class=\"vi16\" data-componentname=\"Paragraph\">\n<div class=\"paragraph tinymce clearfix bg-white table-620-wide\">\n<div class=\"wrapper-980\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"para-content offset-lg-1 col-xl-7 col-lg-9 col-12 ishares-remove-bootstrap-offset\">\n<blockquote>\n<h2>A new way to approach sectors<\/h2>\n<p>Technological advancements are constantly changing the way businesses develop and deliver products and services.

It is a kind of dividend but different. You see, when you buy a bond you are lending your money to a government or corporation with the expectation that you will receive a rate of return back and at the maturation date of the bond you will receive your initial investment. Therefore, I think of the regular payment as a kind of dividend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">The government and corporations issue bonds to raise money for large projects or investments. For example, XYZ Company may issue a bond to raise the money to build a new factory or plant. As the investor, you are part of a group of people funding this bond and you are paid a specific percentage of interest each year until the bond matures. When the bond matures, you receive your principal investment amount back. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">This broad index includes U.S. Government, mortgage-backed, corporate, and foreign government (issued in the U.S.) sectors of the U.S. bond market.

One, it is liquid meaning it can be deployed to deal with emergencies or better yet deployed to take advantage of opportunities in the market. Imagine someone in 2009\/10 timeframe sitting on a pile of cash. They could have poured that into real estate or stocks and would have tripled their money over the subsequent 10 year run!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">Remember, opportunities come every few years.

The monthly cash flow from rents is like a dividend payment each month. In addition, if the property is well maintained and in a good neighborhood, the value steadily <\/span><span class=\"s2\">rises. Another advantage is that the principal on the mortgage is also paid down each month, steadily increasing the cash out potential in the future. There are also many tax advantages to real estate investing like depreciation and certain write offs.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PLEASE NOTE I DO NOT INCLUDE MY PRIMARY RESIDENCE IN THIS ALLOCATION MIX. I consider the primary house as a consumable. Yes, it will increase in value, but the true value comes from the protection and memories built at a home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-innovation-and-individual-dividend-stocks-10-15-strong\"><strong>Innovation and Individual DIVIDEND STOCKS (10-15%)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a change from last year. A portfolio now needs exposure to innovative tech in multiple sectors. I do reserve about 15% of my portfolio for what I used to call \u201cfun money\u201d investing. But I am starting to see this as required diversification for a portfolio that will stand the test of time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few dividend stocks I currently enjoy in no particular order: $O Realty Income, $JNJ, $WPC, $SBUX, $MSFT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please keep in mind this is not crazy casino style investing in whatever I read is the next hot thing. I actually enjoy doing the research into high quality dividend paying stocks and then purchasing shares for free on a platform like Robinhood. This is not for everyone because some people do not like doing this. This is a hobby and a game to me. It is challenging myself to invest and increase dividend payments. I enjoy the research, some of which I share on this blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry enjoys buying and selling options. Options trading is a kind of educated investing and you are guessing which direction a particular stock may go in the short run. There are other strategies that are neutral but leverage your capital in ways. Here are some of our related articles on this practice:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/01\/1-faang-nflx-options-broken\/\" target=\"_blank\">Options Trading<\/a>\n\n\n\n<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2022\/01\/covered-calls-ford-motors\/\" target=\"_blank\">Covered Calls &amp; Dividend Stocks<\/a>\n\n\n\n<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2022\/01\/spy-iron-condor-closed-for-32-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\">Trading Iron Condors<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-1-3-bitcoin-amp-ethereum-strong\"><strong>1-3% Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lately we are understanding the use case for having some exposure to <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/02\/7-reasons-why-hardware-wallet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin<\/a> and some alt coins. Bitcoin is increasingly considered &#8220;digital gold&#8221; simply because of its finite supply. Ethereum demonstrates ever increasing use cases such as DeFi, Smart Contracts and DApps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto is inherently risky and can have wild mood swings, but it has displayed some extraordinary returns. As Bitcoin and Eth are increasingly adopted by institutions and popular platforms, it may rise significantly more in value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, there is a psychological element here. It allows me to have that small amount of risk taking and choice in the investments, beyond just using a straightforward S&amp;P 500 low cost index. I also enjoy learning about what companies do in this world, I find it interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-span-class-s-2-international-amp-small-caps-5-10-span-strong\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">International &amp; Small Caps (5-10%)<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">I put about 10% in a couple International Index Funds and Small Cap Index Funds. This is again for the sake of diversification and broader exposure. In general, my portfolio is one that is betting on the USA with the S&amp;P 500 and Real Estate holdings, but having some international exposure can be good. Small caps also tend to have growth potential, but also upside and downside potential.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">I know that assets will go up and down. <\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Although, I am betting that society will continue to grow, find efficiencies, consume, live, age, etc. <\/strong><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong>I am also betting heavily <\/strong><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong>on the US! <\/strong><\/span><span class=\"s2\">Having a <\/span><span class=\"s2\">well diversified&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"s2\">portfolio of investments allows for <\/span><span class=\"s2\">me to sleep well at night no matter what the market does or does not do.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-there-is-no-perfect-it-is-life-strong\"><strong>There is no Perfect, There is Life<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">I am not saying this is the best portfolio in the world, there are dozens of views about what people should do or not do.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">I am trying to deploy my personal capital into growth potential in several areas. The main thing I am missing from the Ray <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Dalio<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> portfolio is exposure with gold and commodities. As mentioned, I have a hard time with the gold thing for a couple reasons. One, Warren Buffett is not a fan of gold because it is not adding value like a great American business. It\u2019s expensive to get out of the ground and becomes a simple store of value. But why not use cash as a store of value or dare I say crypto currency? That said, some say gold is low now and could rise, who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-risk-management-strong\"><strong>Risk management<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">What we are trying to do is manage risk and let our money grow efficiently and effectively. There will never be a \u201cperfect\u201d portfolio because no one has any idea what the future holds for various asset classes. But having a <\/span><span class=\"s2\">well diversified<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> portfolio, with low fees, and a collection of great American companies is probably as good as it gets. If all this goes down, then we probably have greater problems than the book value of our portfolios.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-bottomline-strong\"><strong>Bottomline<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We keep it simple with accounts through low fee investment companies such as Vanguard, Fidelity, etc. in the following allocations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 INDEX FUNDS (30%)<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>BOND FUNDS (30%)<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"s2\"><strong>REAL ESTATE (15<\/strong><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong>%)<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"s2\"><strong>CASH (10<\/strong><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong>%)<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"s2\"><strong>INTERNATIONAL &amp; SMALL CAPS (5-10%)<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>INNOVATION &amp; OPTIONS (10-15%)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mix is similar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lazyportfolioetf.com\/allocation\/ray-dalio-all-weather\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ray Dalio All Weather Portfolio<\/a>&nbsp;asset allocation mix. Ray argues that too many people are locked into a situation where they do well when the market is up and bad when it is down. He says the all weather type portfolios can do well in both environments for the average investor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">The point here is not to recommend this to any one person. I believe each person has to do their own research, gain the insight of a fiduciary advisor and assess their own level of risk tolerance. For some people maybe it makes sense to simply save cash. Perhaps they do not feel comfortable with markets. They probably will not end up with as much, but they also do not need to stomach the ups and downs of markets.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s2\">Do your research, know yourself and seek advice. A new form of online advice is coming from Personal Capital, which I plan on doing more research and experimentation with in order to write a thoughtful post and review of thei<\/span><span class=\"s2\">r services.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><em>This is not personal financial advice for anyone in particular.
