At the time this was the new way to reverse aging. Little did he know that one day Florida would become the retirement Mecca of the modern day USA. In St. Augustine, the oldest city in the U.S., there&#8217;s a tourist attraction dating back a century that purports to be the Fountain of Youth of 1513.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-16685 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gettyimages-517443544-2-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gettyimages-517443544-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gettyimages-517443544-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gettyimages-517443544-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gettyimages-517443544-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gettyimages-517443544-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>No one has discovered such a fountain yet, and even those living out their golden years in Florida eventually succumb to the ravages of age and time. But what if modern science and technology could hold the key to extending our healthy years of life?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>A New Approach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In the modern era, tech billionaires and countless others are applying science and technology to discover habits, foods, supplements and actions that can at least slow down the aging process. I recently discussed the tech millionaire Bryan Johnson&#8217;s quest to measure his way to actions and nutrition that will dramatically slow down aging.<\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_59682\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/M1cVgSX4-dA?enablejsapi=1&#038;list=PLms5WdQ8kVazs4QKMGrbjvOxHbcFSxbdt&#038;index=11&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3><strong>5 New Ways Gaining Traction<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>So beyond the basics such as nutrition, sleep and exercise, what are some other ways we can slow down the aging process?<\/p>\n<p>And I see this as a national and moral imperative. Here is why. Our collective strength goes up as we improve our health. And the longer we can live a healthy productive life devoid of disease, the better for us, our families and society at large.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sick Care System<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately we still live in a destructive society that has a huge &#8220;sick care&#8221; system.

Here are 5 other ways I am exploring:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fasting<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Intermittent fasting is a dietary pattern that involves alternating periods of eating and fasting. There are many different ways to do intermittent fasting, but a common approach is to eat normally for 8 hours each day and fast for the remaining 16 hours. Studies have shown that intermittent fasting can help to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and protect against age-related diseases.<\/p>\n<div class=\"epyt-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_37537\"  width=\"640\" height=\"360\"  data-origwidth=\"640\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0wVKxrLNEoM?enablejsapi=1&#038;list=PLms5WdQ8kVazs4QKMGrbjvOxHbcFSxbdt&#038;index=14&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=1&#038;cc_lang_pref=en&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Cold therapy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Exposing yourself to cold temperatures, also known as cryotherapy, can help to boost your metabolism, reduce inflammation, and improve cognitive function.

Recent evidence suggests that the clearance of senescent cells alleviates chronic inflammation and its associated dysfunction and diseases.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Senolytics are drugs that are designed to kill senescent cells. Senescent cells are old, damaged cells that accumulate in the body over time. They can contribute to age-related diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Senolytics are still in the early stages of development, but they show promise as a way to reverse aging.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, a way to clear out old cells and debris is through proper rest. Sleep serves this function and cleans our system. Combined with fasting there is a more powerful effect.<\/p>\n<h3 aria-hidden=\"true\"><strong>Many Ways Explored<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It is important to note that these are just a few of the new and emerging ways to reverse aging.
