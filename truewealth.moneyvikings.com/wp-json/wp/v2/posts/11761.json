I bought 100 shares of SLV and 100 shares of COPX several months ago and have been selling short out of the money monthly covered calls against them. Today SLV and COPX both dropped, making my short calls worth more. I usually sell and roll out to the next month when they are worth 50% less than I sold them for, and today that happened in both.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1050\/1*O883bbw-NvmgljQB6gIrAA.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">On 11\/18\/21 I sold the SLV 24 call for .72.

It\u2019s a belief that the yield curve is too flat and needs to steepen or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/meanreversion.asp\" target=\"_blank\">mean revert<\/a> back to more normal times. I did this by selling the 10 year rate and buying the 30 year rate. Today the 10 year rate dropped 8.15% and the 30 year rate only dropped 5.69%. This means that since I entered the trade last week, the spread between the 10 year and 30 year rates increased, which helps move me in the right direction. Technically, on 11\/26, I am down $22 in the trade ($184\u2013$162), but I\u2019m moving in the right direction as long as the rate yield curve continue to steepen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1050\/1*9px1FZF7lImq7o5f2CK8lA.png\" alt=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cc95\">I use TastyWorks to trade the yield curve in this way.
