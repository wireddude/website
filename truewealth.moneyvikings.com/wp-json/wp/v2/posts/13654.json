As the&nbsp;climate transitions to and we consider the future, I truly believe we must be good stewards of our environment, but not for the environment, for us. <strong><i>Here is my greedy green thinking: If we destroy the environment, we destroy our health, our enjoyment and our children&#8217;s futures.

In other words, it has nothing to do with the bugs, bunnies and trees, I am concerned with us. And this thinking led me to ESG investing a few years back, which stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. The idea being that the companies are screened so as not to contain companies that are doing &#8220;bad things&#8221; to the environment, to people (society) and are being governed in an ethical manner. I started with about a 5-10% of assets position into the Vanguard ESG fund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-what-is-in-an-esg-fund-and-is-it-just-marketing-strong\"><strong>What is in an ESG fund and is it just marketing?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely could be!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-does-esg-investing-work-strong\"><strong>Does ESG Investing Work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2310\" height=\"1116\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/img_5912-1.png\" alt=\"ESG vs SPY\" class=\"wp-image-13676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/img_5912-1.png 2310w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/img_5912-1-300x145.png 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/img_5912-1-1024x495.png 1024w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/img_5912-1-768x371.png 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/img_5912-1-1536x742.png 1536w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/img_5912-1-2048x989.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2310px) 100vw, 2310px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is generally to remove big oil, big tobacco, and other so called bad actors.
