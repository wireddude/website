This brings us to our enjoyment of a good cup of coffee with a friend or family member. If done right, there are amazing health and financial effects.<\/p>\n<p>Personal finance bloggers are supposed to say \u201cNever go to Starbucks and don\u2019t buy avocado toast!\u201d I actually happen to like going to Starbucks SOMETIMES and I enjoy a good avocado toast (but I make that at home)!<\/p>\n<p>Certainly do not go every day, that would be a waste of money. I also like buying shares of SBUX so I can use the dividends to buy the coffee. Jerry bought enough Starbucks stock to buy his coffee from the dividends, he is clever like that.<\/p>\n<p>Another good cost savings trick is to share with a friend! But let\u2019s focus on the coffee part of the equation, turns out it is a wonderful substance to consume for our health if we do it right. We should be thinking coffee with minimal cream and sugar in order to not negate the health benefits. The ideal is a coffee perhaps with a shot of milk. We are not talking about those milkshake coffee drinks!<\/p>\n<h2>In other words, LIFE CAN BE A GRIND, Buy a Starbucks with a friend!<\/h2>\n<p>Studies have shown that when people take a coffee break with coworkers stress levels go down.

In fact, Americans now drink more coffee than ever. Coffee consumption is up by 5% since 2015 \u2014 and 62% of Americans drink coffee every day.<sup>1<\/sup> Its popularity has even spilled into internet culture with the trendy saying, \u201cBut first, coffee.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Drinking coffee and tea has also been linked to a range of health benefits for the brain, lungs, liver, metabolism, and more.<sup>2<\/sup> But what happens when we add too much milk, cream, or sweetener? A coffee drink loaded with sugar and calories can turn into an unhealthy beverage choice. The good news is you can still have your coffee and make it healthy.<\/p>\n<p>To help get new ideas brewing, Sean Hashmi, MD, physician and regional director of weight management and clinical nutrition for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, shares these recommendations on how to drink your coffee \u2014 and feel good about it.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Drink it black<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The healthiest way to drink coffee is plain with nothing added \u2014 also known as drinking it black. Dr. Hashmi explains, \u201cIdeally, you shouldn\u2019t put sugar in your coffee. If you train your taste buds to have your coffee sweetened, you\u2019ll crave that sweetness like an addiction.\u201d We know that when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/thrive.kaiserpermanente.org\/thrive-together\/eat-healthy\/sugar-sweeteners-less-is-best\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sugar and sweeteners<\/a>, less is always best.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Try plant-based milks<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re adding milk to your coffee, unsweetened plant-based milks usually have less sugar than regular cow\u2019s milk. \u201cReplacing dairy milk with a nut-based milk is a healthy habit that can reduce saturated fats than can cause issues like heart disease and diabetes,\u201d says Dr. Hashmi.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Spice it up<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are some spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cacao, and ginger that have a natural sweetness and flavor to them. You can add them to your coffee grounds before brewing or sprinkle them directly in your cup for a change of taste. For another buzz-worthy recipe, <a href=\"https:\/\/about.kaiserpermanente.org\/total-health\/food-for-health\/recipes\/cold-brew-coffee-whats-the-buzz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">try making your own cold brew coffee<\/a>. Brewing at a lower temperature can give you a smooth coffee that\u2019s lower in acidity and bitterness.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Turmeric<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Tumeric is another spice that can add extra health benefits to the coffee. The trick though is that tumeric has to be paired with a dash of pepper for the body to absorb it properly.\u00a0Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory. Keeping inflammation down in the body appears to be a key strategy in preserving long term health.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Consider the caffeine<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The maximum recommended amount of caffeine per day is 400 milligrams, which is about 4 cups of brewed coffee. So, if you\u2019re drinking more than 4 cups of coffee per day, you should try a combination of caffeinated and decaffeinated. Keep in mind some coffee shop drinks have more than 1 cup per serving, depending on the size. Dr. Hashmi says, \u201cIt\u2019s also a good idea to avoid caffeinated beverages after 10 a.m. Consuming caffeine throughout the day can lead to a jittery feeling or sleep issues at night.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Be good to your body<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Dr. Hashmi explains, \u201cThere are many benefits to drinking coffee, but you have to be mindful about how you drink it. When it comes to nutrition, I like to think that what you put in your body must have a good ROI (return on investment). If you don\u2019t get anything nutritious out of it, it\u2019s not worth your time.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>FROM CNN Health<\/h2>\n<div class=\"el__leafmedia el__leafmedia--sourced-paragraph\">\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph speakable\" data-paragraph-id=\"paragraph_D28B975B-D1CC-31BB-3782-1FB2255C11D4\" data-act-id=\"paragraph_0\">Drinking up to three or four cups of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee a day reduces your risk of developing and dying from chronic liver diseases, a new study found.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"el__embedded el__embedded--standard\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"el__storyelement--standard el__article--embed\">\n<div class=\"el__article--teaseimage\">\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/04\/22\/health\/healthiest-coffee-brew-wellness\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"media__image media__image--responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-medium-plus-169.jpg\" alt=\"The healthiest way to brew your coffee -- and possibly lengthen your life\" data-src-mini=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-small-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-small=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-large-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-super-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-full-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-small-11.jpg\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-src=\"\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/190626100435-woman-drinking-coffee-stock-medium-plus-169.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"img__preloader\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"media__caption el__storyelement__title\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/04\/22\/health\/healthiest-coffee-brew-wellness\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The healthiest way to brew your coffee &#8212; and possibly lengthen your life<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\" data-paragraph-id=\"paragraph_1C862033-43B9-7E2F-CF4F-1FB59FABF962\" data-act-id=\"paragraph_1\">Coffee drinkers were 21% less likely to develop chronic liver disease, 20% less likely to develop chronic or fatty liver disease, and 49% less likely to die from chronic liver disease than non-coffee drinkers, <a href=\"https:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12889-021-10991-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the study published Monday in the journal BMC Public Health<\/a>.<\/div>\n<div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\" data-paragraph-id=\"paragraph_C347AA4A-0091-C0A1-B406-1FB99B8F3F17\" data-act-id=\"paragraph_2\">&#8220;Coffee is widely accessible, and the benefits we see from our study may mean it could offer a potential preventative treatment for chronic liver disease,&#8221; said study author Dr. Oliver Kennedy, who is on the medical faculty of the University of Southampton in the UK, in a statement.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<h2><strong>Starbucks Stock, Mocha Dividends<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>SBUX has been re inventing itself lately, as every great company typically must do to adapt to changing times.<\/p>\n<p>The future growth in the company probably relies on outside the U.S. markets.\u00a0China is the company&#8217;s second largest market and shows potential for expansion.
