As we age, we tend to lose muscle mass and this can result in a reduction in overall strength and functionality. Having sufficient muscle mass ensures that we can carry out daily activities, maintain good posture, and perform physical tasks with ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"improved-metabolism\"><strong>Improved Metabolism<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Muscle mass plays an important role in metabolism. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue, even at rest. This means that having more muscle mass can help you burn more calories throughout the day, which can lead to a more efficient metabolism and potentially help with weight management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"reduced-risk-of-chronic-disease\"><strong>Reduced Risk of Chronic Disease<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining muscle mass has been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis. This is because muscle tissue helps to regulate blood sugar levels, support the cardiovascular system, and maintain bone density. By building and maintaining muscle mass, you can reduce your risk of these chronic diseases and improve your overall health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"quick-money-viking-workouts\"><strong>Quick Money Viking Workouts<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Quick Workouts You Can Do On the Cheap!\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jGE92D_hBW0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/pexels-photo-1552106-199x300.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15503\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/pexels-photo-1552106-199x300.webp 199w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/pexels-photo-1552106-680x1024.webp 680w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/pexels-photo-1552106-768x1157.webp 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/pexels-photo-1552106.webp 996w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"10-Minute BBG-Style Beginner Dumbbell Workout\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eHupL5rDPUU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-ways-to-increase-muscle-mass\"><strong>5 Ways to Increase Muscle Mass<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-resistance-training\"><strong>1. Resistance Training<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Resistance training, also known as weight training, involves using weights or other forms of resistance to stress and overload the muscles. This type of training causes microscopic tears in the muscle fibers, which then repair and grow stronger during the recovery period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-progressive-overload\"><strong>2. Progressive Overload<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To build muscle, you need to continually challenge your muscles by increasing the weight, reps, or sets of your exercises. This is known as progressive overload, and it ensures that your muscles are always adapting and growing stronger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-proper-nutrition\"><strong>3. Proper Nutrition<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building muscle requires a combination of resistance training and proper nutrition. You need to consume enough calories, protein, and other essential nutrients to support muscle growth and repair. Aim to consume a balanced diet that includes lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the basics of <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/03\/mediterranean-diet\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Mediterranean diet<\/a>, said to be one of the most effective diets for humans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-rest-and-recovery\"><strong>4. Rest and Recovery<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rest and recovery are just as important as training and nutrition when it comes to building muscle. Your muscles need time to recover and repair after each workout, so make sure you allow for adequate rest periods between workouts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-consistency\"><strong>5. Consistency<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency is key when it comes to building muscle. Aim to train regularly, ideally 3-4 times per week, and stick to your nutrition and recovery plan. It may take several months or even years to achieve your desired results, but with consistent effort, you will see progress over time.
