Keeping the dream alive and giving myself more time to be right!<br \/>&#8211; Sold 1 ASTR 11\/19\/21 Put 10.00 @ 2.23<br \/>&#8211; Bought 1 ASTR 10\/15\/21 Put 10.00 @ 1.73<br \/><br \/>9\/16\/21 &#8211; After a couple says waiting to be filled, finally was able to roll my $10 strike short put in September to October 15th for $75 credit. This puts us ahead in the trade by $24 overall and buys us more time for ASTR to exceed the 10$ strike price. <br \/><br \/>9\/13\/21 &#8211; With ASTR below the $10 strike and &lt; 21 days until expiration, we are looking to either 1) roll the put for a credit, or 2) get assigned and sell calls against it, which is known as &#8220;wheeling&#8221;. I currently have an order waiting to fill to roll from Sept 17th, to October 15th for a $75 credit. The call option we purchased will most likely expire for a loss.<br \/><br \/><strong>8\/30\/21<\/strong> &#8211; On 8\/10 we sold the Sept 17th 10 strike put, and bought the Sept 17th 12.50 strike call for a $51 debit. We were hoping that ASTR&#8217;s first rocket launch in the coming days would help the stock rocket into the stratosphere, however there\u00a0was a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/moneyvikings.us6.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=6e6d68c1dcf85d431c4821ef5&amp;id=09a506ce60&amp;e=2f8d21ca4d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malfunction on Saturday<\/a>.\u00a0With the stock trading at 10.62 after hours on Friday, we were not in any danger of having to purchase 100 shares, but since closing below $10.00 on Monday, we may want to consider closing the trade for a loss, or holding and taking on the risk of potential ownership if the stock stabilizes. <br \/><br \/>8\/23\/21 &#8211; ASTR is heading higher. We&#8217;re up 30$ on the 10 strike put, but down -86 on the 12.5 call\u2026 just need more upward momentum and time.<br \/><br \/>On 8\/16, seems $ASTR is attempting to get back to it&#8217;s HMA. We continue to stay in the trade and monitor.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On 8\/10 or 8\/11, consider $<strong>ASTR<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Astra Space Inc Class A has earnings on 8\/12. Money Vikings have a bullish assumption in this one. We\u2019re Selling a put to finance the call. Earnings could be the catalyst we need to push it higher. If we\u2019re correct and the price goes up, we capture the upside from our call. If we\u2019re wrong, we\u2019re obligated to buy 100 shares of the stock at $10.00\/share. If you don\u2019t want to buy, you could alternative roll out another month to October.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"531\" class=\"wp-image-10012\" src=\"https:\/\/premium.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/unknown-1024x531.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/unknown-1024x531.png 1024w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/unknown-300x156.png 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/unknown-768x399.png 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/unknown-1536x797.png 1536w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/unknown.png 1667w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Bob\u2019s take \u2013 Bob is Bullish ASTR and there are earnings on the 12th of August after market close.
