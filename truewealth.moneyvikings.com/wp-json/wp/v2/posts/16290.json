It has a number of important functions in the body, including regulating heart function, protecting the liver, and improving vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taurine\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taurine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Taurine<\/a> &#8211; more info,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.abn9257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.abn9257 <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in the potential benefits of longevity. Studies have shown that people with higher levels of it in their blood tend to live longer and have a lower risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the ways that it may help promote longevity:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Protects the heart.<\/strong> It is a powerful antioxidant that can help protect the heart from damage caused by free radicals. It can also help improve heart function by reducing inflammation and preventing the buildup of plaque in the arteries.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Protects the liver.<\/strong> It is essential for the proper functioning of the liver, which is responsible for filtering toxins out of the blood. It can help protect the liver from damage caused by alcohol, drugs, and other toxins.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improves vision.<\/strong> It is essential for the proper development and function of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It can help improve vision by reducing the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduces inflammation.<\/strong> It is an anti-inflammatory agent that can help reduce inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and cancer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improves insulin sensitivity.<\/strong> It can help improve insulin sensitivity, which is the body&#8217;s ability to use glucose for energy. This can help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While more research is needed to confirm the link between taurine and longevity, the available evidence suggests that it may be a valuable nutrient for promoting long-term health. If you are looking for ways to improve your health and extend your lifespan, adding taurine-rich foods to your diet or taking a taurine supplement may be a good place to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/21655853840_2466923325.jpg\" alt=\"Healthy human T cell\" class=\"wp-image-16291\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/21655853840_2466923325.jpg 500w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/21655853840_2466923325-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-get-more\">How to Get More<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get more is to eat foods that are naturally high in this nutrient.
