We live in an environment with a media circus machine with one mission: extract dollars from advertisers and consumers. Our educational system seems afraid to teach people about money, perhaps out of cultural taboos. And we are bombarded with illusions of wealth and happiness from the Kardashians and Hollywood machine. This is why we love books such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2022\/01\/be-the-millionaire-next-door\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11834\" target=\"_blank\">Millionaire Next Door.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-a-recipe-for-failure-strong\"><strong>A Recipe For Failure<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This all adds up to a recipe for failure for most people to achieve any level of wealth or personal financial stability. Therefore we launched the Money Vikings blog (Money Vikings 1.0). We worked over the course of a few years to research and collect the best and most effective wealth building ideas we could find. We became guinea pigs for new platforms and ideas, some worked and others did not. And we did this in an honest, fun and prudent way to build wealth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-mv-2-0-strong\"><strong>MV 2.0<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Money Vikings 2.0 was launched during the Pandemic lockdowns. During this period we built a discord community, started a podcast, and launched our newsletter. This period was marked by a rocket fueled meme and easy money infused environment. Almost all assets simply went up each month after the initial pandemic market swoon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was frankly an easy time to &#8220;invest&#8221; and we saw many new younger investors enter the market. Free money flowing and easy gains. Everything was the next big thing to the moon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-the-22-23-descent-down-to-earth-nbsp-strong\"><strong>The 22-23 Descent Down to Earth&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The everything bubble finally popped when inflation started running rampant and the Fed started jacking up interest rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-money-vikings-3-0-strong\"><strong>Money Vikings 3.0<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to MV 3.0.
