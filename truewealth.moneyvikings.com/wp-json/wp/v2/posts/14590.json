There are many different ways to do intermittent fasting, but some common methods include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Improved metabolic health: Intermittent fasting can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin resistance, which can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, which is associated with a range of chronic diseases.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight loss: Intermittent fasting can be an effective way to lose weight, as it often involves eating fewer calories overall. Additionally, fasting can lead to an increase in growth hormone levels, which can help to preserve muscle mass while promoting fat loss.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brain health: Studies have suggested that intermittent fasting may have benefits for brain health. For example, it has been shown to increase the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is involved in the growth and survival of neurons. This may help to improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Feel Better: I am noticing that I just feel better and have more energy through the day. I am also focusing this with the concept of reducing blood sugar spikes from high sugar foods with no fats or proteins.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"different-methods\"><strong>Different Methods<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To do intermittent fasting, there are several different methods to choose from. Some common options include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>16\/8 method: This involves fasting for 16 hours each day and eating during an 8-hour window. For example, you might eat between 12 pm and 8 pm each day, and fast for the remaining 16 hours.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5:2 method: This involves eating normally for five days of the week and reducing calorie intake to 500-600 calories for the other two days.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alternate-day fasting: This involves fasting every other day, either by eating nothing or consuming a limited number of calories (e.g. 500 calories).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>My simple method. If some of this is too complicated, I am simply skipping breakfast. This means that if my last meal was the night before around 6:00, then if I eat an early lunch or late breakfast at say 10:30, then over 15 hours have passed between meals.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"consult-a-medical-pro\"><strong>Consult a Medical Pro<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that intermittent fasting is not suitable for everyone. Everyone should discuss the concept with their medical professional. If you have a history of disordered eating, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or have certain medical conditions, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before trying intermittent fasting. This is not medical or health advice to anyone!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more\"><strong>More<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At Money Vikings we try many life hacks like intermittent fasting to be as strong as possible.
