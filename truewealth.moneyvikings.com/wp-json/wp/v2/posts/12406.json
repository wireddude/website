Triple net real estate investment trusts are back. Rent collection is back to pre-pandemic levels. yields are strong for several quality REIT&#8217;s. I like them for the growth potential and the income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-inflation-amp-recession-resistant-strong\"><strong>Inflation &amp; Recession Resistant<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the REIT Real Estate Investments I am currently adding are inflation and recession resistant. Notice I did not say recession proof, but some are strong enough they can withstand the pressures. I recently added Agree REIT (ADC) and W.P. Carey, which I believe fit this criteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High quality REIT&#8217;s are my perfect sleep well at night investments. Yes, there is risk to any investment, but well managed REITs have distinct advantages and staying power. They help me modulate volatility, preserve capital and grow wealth. All with an easy to understand business model or sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-o-realty-income-strong\"><strong>O, REALTY INCOME<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, the classic and the one of the REIT Real Estate Investment Trusts, the best triple net REIT&#8217;s out there: Realty Income (Ticker: O), cleverly marketed as the monthly dividend player in the REIT space. Gives one that feeling of collecting monthly rents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realty Income operates an impressive portfolio in all kinds of industries.&nbsp;<span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">I am a long term owner of O stock, Realty Income. This is another strong REIT. <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">Realty Income is a high-quality income vehicle for investors with a moderate risk tolerance.<\/span><\/span> <span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">A U.S. recession may be in the cards, exposing income investors to growing downside risks, but this is still a steady long term play. Here is more information about&nbsp;Realty Income &#8220;O&#8221;.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yield:\u00a0Ex-Dividend Date 08\/31\/2021 \u00b7 <em>Dividend Yield<\/em> 3.91% \u00b7 Annual Dividend $2.826 \u00b7 P\/E Ratio 73.41<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DLR, Digital Realty Trust, 4.4% yield<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLR is a data center REIT that owns and manages over 300 data centers. Data centers are one leg of the e-commerce trifecta where cell towers, logistics and data centers work together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MPW, Medical Properties Trust, 9% yield!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess what, no matter what happens in the economy or the world, human bodies and minds will always require healthcare at some point. MPW owns hospitals and clinics and continues to increase revenue. In addition, some of their leases are tied to CPI and inflation, meaning that the rental proceeds increase with inflation. Add a 5% juicy yield on top of this growth machine<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Crown Castle &amp; American Tower<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another one with a high valuation, but for a reason. It owns thousands of cell tower sites and continues to grow. Any dips I will be buying or at least have some exposure via ETF\u2019s like VNQ. Add 5G and the infrastructure spending for further growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-vanguard-real-estate-etf-vnq-strong\"><strong>VANGUARD REAL ESTATE ETF (VNQ)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the Vanguard REIT Real Estate ETF.

But those nice stable investment returns and appreciation of capital are sure nice, it is like the demand cannot keep up with supply when it comes to real estate. But if you do not want to respond to maintenance calls, have you heard of a REIT Real Estate Investment Trust? This article will talk all about REITs and compare them to traditional &#8220;hands on&#8221; real estate investing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write a lot about <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/01\/reit-power-investors\/\" target=\"_blank\">real estate<\/a> because I have a passion for it as a thing and as an investment vehicle. It may have something to do with my arts background, but I enjoy a well designed and well maintained property. Think about how essential real estate is to our modern lives. It keeps us safe, healthy and provides a platform for some of our greatest family memories. It is the grocery store, mall, coffee shop, warehouse, office complex, fast food joint, pharmacy, etc. Real estate in general is an excellent asset class in many ways. But it is important to consider all the pros and cons of the different ways to invest in real estate. <strong>In this article we focus on one that can be very easy to enter and easy to manage, high quality real estate investment trusts, or REITs<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-medium wp-image-11242\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pexels-photo-1370704-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"REIT Real Estate\" class=\"wp-image-11242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pexels-photo-1370704-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pexels-photo-1370704-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pexels-photo-1370704-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pexels-photo-1370704-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pexels-photo-1370704.jpeg 1733w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo by Jessica Bryant on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/assorted-color-wall-paint-house-photo-1370704\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pexels.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-what-is-a-reit-real-estate-investment-trust-strong\"><strong>What is a REIT Real Estate Investment Trust?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A REIT is a company that owns and in many cases operates income producing real estate. An investor can buy shares of these companies. In other words, a REIT is a pool of properties and mortgages bundled together. The company offers shares of these combined assets in the form of a security or stock that an individual can buy into. There are all kinds of REITs that specialize in different types of real estate including office\/commercial, apartment buildings\/housing, hospitals, shopping centers, hotels, etc. REITs were invented as a real estate vehicle under a Public Law signed by President Eisenhower. REITs give all investors access to large scale real estate development investing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-irs-rule-on-income-strong\"><strong>IRS Rule on Income<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One really neat feature of REITs is that IRS rules require the company to pay out 90% of their income back to share unit holders. This is typically in the form of a dividend. Dividend income is one of several strategies Money Vikings are harnessing to reach FI, so this makes REITs an ideal investment vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-reit-vs-hands-on-real-estate-ownership-strong\"><strong>REIT vs. Hands On Real Estate Ownership<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to run some numbers and look at the pros and cons of owning\/investing in REIT&#8217;s vs actual hands on real estate investment ownership. The result may surprise you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say you invest in a $500,000 investment property (single family home) in a nice middle class neighborhood. You put $100,000 down and finance the remaining $400,000. In this scenario it is important to remember that your actual investment is $100,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-reit-real-estate-investment-strong-vs-brick-and-mortar-rental\"><strong>REIT Real Estate Investment<\/strong> vs Brick and Mortar Rental<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On a $400,000 mortgage the total cost of principle, interest (4-5%), escrow for taxes, would be about $2,500\/month<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add another $100\/month for landscaping and another $100\/month for deferred maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The house would cost about $2,700\/month in expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BOTTOMLINE:&nbsp;If you look at the rental market and let\u2019s say the property would rent for about $3,100\/month. <span class=\"s2\">So a person would be looking at a $400\/month cash flow \u201cprofit\u201d.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, keep in mind that this investment takes a lot of hands on care and feeding: There will be maintenance calls to respond to at off hours. Changes of occupancy to manage, advertising, screening tenants, contracts to negotiate and sign. Long term maintenance to manage. Minor and major repairs, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on the other hand, over many years you will be building equity in the property. So as the $400k note is drawn down and the price appreciates at 3-5% annually, the value of that investment can grow from the original $100k to $200k, $300k, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-reit-real-estate-investment-trust-strong\"><strong>REIT Real Estate Investment Trust<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s analyze a $100,000 investment in a REIT. A very popular and strong REIT is the company Realty Income, ticker symbol \u201cO\u201d which we have written about before. With $100,000 you could by 1,538 shares of \u201cO\u201d at $65\/share. The stock offers a 4% dividend yield. One really neat thing that I love about \u201cO\u201d is that they pay the dividend monthly, which makes it feel like a traditional real estate investment. Each share returns .221\/share per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"s2\">BOTTOMLINE: .221 x 1,538 shares = $340\/month cash<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> flow<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this with no calls in the middle of the night due to a leaky roof!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-span-class-s-2-bottomline-span-strong\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">Bottomline<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s2\">As you can see from this simplified example, the investment in a high quality Real Estate Investment Trust can offer some comparable returns and cash flow. <\/span>The REIT investment certainly has far less \u201cheadaches\u201d in terms of day to day management. All investing holds some level of risk. The company could tank and the shares lose value. On the other hand, investing in physical real estate you manage has its fair share of risks. A major repair could certainly set you back at almost any time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like working with both REIT\u2019s and traditional real estate. But for someone that does not want to deal with Tenants, contracts, repairs and hands on management, REIT is the way to gain exposure to the real estate sector. And looking at some of the initial numbers, may provide many of the returns and pure financial results.&nbsp;Ideally the value of the REIT shares will rise just as the underlying value of any real estate asset will rise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-a-few-more-examples-of-quality-top-of-the-line-reit-real-estate-investments-strong\"><strong>A Few MORE examples of quality top of the line REIT Real Estate Investments:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strong-wp-carey-wpc-span-class-s-2-span-class-bumped-font-20-span-span-strong\"><strong>WP Carey &#8220;WPC<span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont20\">\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpcarey.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WP Carey Site<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Company generated $1.31 of AFFO, beating expectations of $1.29 and up from $1.27 last year.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3% same-store rent growth is the highest in years, reflecting CPI-based lease escalators.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lease rates and rent collections remain above the 99% level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Raised the bottom end of full year AFFO guidance range.
