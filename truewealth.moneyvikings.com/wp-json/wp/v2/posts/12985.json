Put your money to work into businesses today that may take years to pay off in terms of value or efficiency. One challenge is that our prehistoric minds are designed to focus on immediate needs, and the concept of taking care of some far off future seems highly diminished in light of todays needs and wants. But the reality is that without an investment framework or system, the marvels and advancements of today are impossible.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Your Life Depends On It<\/h2>\r\n<p>I believe we should invest like our lives depend on it, because they do. We will never make enough money to afford a comfortable retirement, therefore our money needs to work for our future selves little by little. And without investors, companies would not grow and provide value back to society through their products and back to shareholders in the return of asset appreciation.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Break Things Down<\/h2>\r\n<p>I am a big believe in first principles, which is the idea that things need to be broken down to be understood. The same is true for investing. When our ancestors chopped wood to prepare for a harsh winter, they were making an investment. We get up and do some exercise&#8211;we are investing. Helping our children learn is investing.<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Investing can be thought of as actions and energy we take in the present, that pay off even more in the future.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>All said, how do we invest? Here are 7 fundamentals that I still live by many decades later as an investor.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<h2>1. Asset Allocation<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-12260 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/saupload_Callan-Period-Table-of-Investment-Returns-1994-2013-300x232.png\" alt=\"Callan\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/saupload_Callan-Period-Table-of-Investment-Returns-1994-2013-300x232.png 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/saupload_Callan-Period-Table-of-Investment-Returns-1994-2013-1024x793.png 1024w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/saupload_Callan-Period-Table-of-Investment-Returns-1994-2013-768x595.png 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/saupload_Callan-Period-Table-of-Investment-Returns-1994-2013.png 1177w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Never forget to look at your portfolio of assets as a whole and determine what percentage is in the various asset classes. Is it an effective allocation? Take a step back. How do you divide your portfolio among different asset categories? This may be the biggest determinant of your investment returns. I find this is where many investors fail because they put little thought or effort into their asset allocation strategy.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For me personally, I harness the tailwinds of bull markets and blunt the impacts of bear markets\/recessions. I do this through <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2021\/08\/10-stocks-etfs-for-the-long-run-investment-longboats\/\" target=\"_blank\">strategic minor adjustments to asset allocations during different investment periods<\/a>. Most people have a portfolio that does well in good market times and does poorly when the overall market goes down. Think about overall portfolio construction in terms of what percentage of the following you may hold.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Asset Allocation Ideas<\/h3>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Stocks<\/strong> (equities), and within this category how much is small caps, mid caps, large caps. How much is growth vs. value stocks. How much is international, tech, etc.?<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Bonds<\/strong> (fixed income), what is the quality of the bond ratings? Is the fund sufficiently diversified? How much to allocate to bonds typically depends on risk tolerance and age. Bonds are a lending asset vs. ownership. You are lending your money to an entity to do something, and the issuer returns a fixed percentage back to you over time.<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Cash<\/strong>, how much is being held in cash? This is typically rainy day emergency money or money that sits waiting for big investment opportunities.<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Alternative assets<\/strong>: Gold, crypto, etc. can be considered alternatives and generally more risky, but could have a small place in a well balanced approach.<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Hard assets<\/strong>: real estate is an example here of an asset that is tangible and manageable. Is there a place for these kinds of assets? \u00a0<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>2. Dollar Cost Averaging &amp; Automation<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This is the time for dollar cost averaging to really help to grow wealth. If you are automating a certain percentage of your income each month to index funds, right now you are adding shares on discount compared to last year. These are the times when this engine really gets going! I would not miss this opportunity to add shares on sale. This is one of the main reasons I invest in 2023.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h2>3. Diversify Strategically<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-13067\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/asset-allocation-piechart-300x295.webp\" alt=\"diversification\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/asset-allocation-piechart-300x295.webp 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/asset-allocation-piechart-768x755.webp 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/asset-allocation-piechart.webp 889w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>I think strategic diversification is most effective when we are harnessing the power of macro trends. For example, the world is aging and will need more medicines, therefore I may add a but more healthcare or Pharma exposure to a portfolio. This type of diversification is also critical because it can be hard to pick individual winning stocks. Strategic diversification delivers enormous benefits. It can be quite hard for example to pick individual stock winners in competitive industries.\u00a0But we still may want to capture gains in particular thematic areas. This is a main reason I choose many thematic ETF&#8217;s. I am not saying to randomly diversify, I am saying be thoughtful about overall portfolio construction. If heavy in growth tech, perhaps add some value ETF&#8217;s. Try and add some uncorrelated assets. Perhaps some crypto is a good place to diversify into uncharted territory?<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Both under diversification and over diversification are common mistakes made in portfolio management. Most studies show optimization occurs somewhere between 15 and 30 individual investments. Beyond this becomes too much to manage and may provide diminishing returns. I like to have some classic plays like a solid S&amp;P dividend ETF (may favorite is VDADX), a bond fund and a few core holdings that I do not touch. We can pad this with exposure to sector ETF&#8217;s and some individual stocks that I believe are good mid term plays. I sprinkle in 2-3% crypto, 10% REIT&#8217;s and Real Estate, 10% international and I have diversified pretty well. \u00a0<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h2>4. Invest For the Long Term<\/h2>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_13070\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-13070\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-13070 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/daniel-j-schwarz-xmc9mbscpzm-unsplash-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"long term investing\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-13070\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/it\/@danieljschwarz\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel J.

But 95% of assets are in long term investments. Effective investors realize if you buy an investment at a favorable price it may take time for the market to recognize its true value.\u00a0Long term investing is one of the most important investing principles because short term trading usually leads to poor long term performance. This is common because many investors let fear and greed cause them to make bad decisions. The long term will take care of itself if you make wise investment decisions. <a href=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/2023\/01\/build-a-robot-wealth-building-army\/\" target=\"_blank\">PASSIVE INCOME MACHINES<\/a>: I like to discuss PIM (passive income machines) as much as possible because it helps people keep the long term in mind when looking at their account balances. The ideal situation is that there should never be a day when you cash everything out of an investment account. Instead, we should look at the account like a small business we own that has the potential to spin off income each and every month and hopefully grow over the long run. This is why I invest in 2023.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h2>5. Keep Expenses Low<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Most investors don\u2019t realize how much difference high expenses make to their portfolio. Take a look at the what happens to your returns with a 1% higher expense ratio; On a $100k investment over 30 years, a .4% expense ratio vs. a 1.4% ratio, seems like only 1%. It adds up to $146k lost in fees!!!<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>The bottom-line: over a 30 year period, expenses of 1% can cost your portfolio dearly<\/strong>. <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/investment-products\/mutual-funds\/low-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Vanguard is a good example of a company that offers some of the lowest fees around to retail investors!<\/a><\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h2>6. Do Not Forget About Compounding<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-13068\" src=\"http:\/\/198.199.80.40\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Easy-Wealth-Building-300x300.png\" alt=\"compounding\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Easy-Wealth-Building-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Easy-Wealth-Building-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Easy-Wealth-Building-768x770.png 768w, https:\/\/truewealth.moneyvikings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Easy-Wealth-Building.png 1001w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Compounding is a powerful financial concept but it needs time to take hold. It is like planting a young fruit tree, it takes time for the fruit to mature and arrive. I specifically like the power of dividend growth compounding. Basically, every dollar made over time that is reinvested makes even more dollars. Make sure you enable DRIP (dividend reinvestment in your brokerage for dividend stocks and ETFs). I have seen this work effectively with my positions in Realty Income (O) &amp; Pfizer (PFE) over the years. The share prices have done ok, but the dividends have kept coming and I had them reinvested. During down times they bought more shares and during the up times those increased number of shares rose the entire accounts value.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h2>7. Anticipate Market Volatility and Use Risk Management<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Why invest in 2023? Markets are unpredictable and volatile, you say. One day up, one day down and on and on. You can control your portfolio volatility but you cannot control the inevitable volatility of investment markets. Therefore, you should be prepared to take advantage of investment opportunities. At the same time, you need to be cognizant of overvalued assets and be willing to move to cash when conditions are unfavorable. Admittedly, this is not easy, but with a sound approach it can be done in many conditions. \u00a0<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h2>Manage Your Own Destiny<\/h2>\r\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>There are all kinds of investment advisors out there that will lead people astray. We need to educate ourselves and take charge of our own financial situation. And this is not easy in a sometimes confusing environment with a lot of noise. We want less noise and more signal.\u00a0Technology and the internet have brought down transaction costs and provide the means to get information and guidance at a very low cost. There has never been a better time period for the self-directed investor who is willing to put a little effort into investing. But, in order for this to be successful we need to manage our emotions and increase our financial intelligence.
