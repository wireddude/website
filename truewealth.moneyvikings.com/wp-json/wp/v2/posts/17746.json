Whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds are fiber champions, so make them a regular part of your diet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Polyphenol Parade:<\/strong> These plant-based compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and dark chocolate are like antioxidants for your gut. They help protect your microbiome from harmful free radicals and inflammation, creating a safe and healthy environment for your gut bugs to flourish.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\">Polyphenolrich foods like fruits, vegetables, and dark chocolate<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>5.
